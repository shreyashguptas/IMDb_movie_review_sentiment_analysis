Permalink",266,300,6,"Great visuals, excellent fight scenes, good choices on most of the cast (e.g Kano, Scorpion, Sub-Zero) and just a fun movie overall. If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.Fight scenes get more rewarding halfway through, closer to the game style.Also, the idea to rotate this film's story around the rivalry between scorpion and sub-zero worked; it gave some background. Maybe the lead protagonist is not that interesting compared to the other characters but he seems necessary to keep the story moving forward.So, this first film does the job and although not everyone from the game is in it, I m sure all the other favorite characters will appear in the next 2 films and I m looking forward to that.6,5/10 good effort bringing the game on film screen.",

Permalink",57,73,5,"16 years after the last Hollywood version we get another MORTAL KOMBAT video game adaptation and funnily enough it's about the same quality as the last one. Grittier to begin with and Hiroyuki Sanada is one of those guys who automatically lifts the quality of the thing by his presence alone, but then it ends up turning into the usual CGI dominated cheese fest by the climax. They try to make sense of some kind of plot here which is quite excruciating but by the end it's just the usual intercutting of heavily stylised fights between the player characters. Kudos for the copious gore FX and the CGI isn't as bad as it could have been, but I was hoping for more.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",392,523,7,"I enjoyed MK overall, it was funny, action packed and generally quite faithful as an adaptation. The acting was also really good, with Joe Taslim as Subzero being the highlight for me. I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.I also didn't gravitate towards the newcomer Cole, I felt like he was unnecessary, I understand wanting to do your own thing sometimes but this was not one of those times. He also beats an iconic MK character which rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully we'll see them again. The opening is brilliant and the second act is solid, but it's final act is very rushed and leaves you with little time to take it all in. Pretty good but not what I was hoping for.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",577,745,7,"Great action and fight choreography as was to be expected from a movie with this title, special effects regarding characters and their abilities were also very well done especially considering the budget constraints this movie had. Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.",

Permalink",46,62,6,"Earth is on the verge of annihilation. After nine victories by Outworld, they are one loss away from the Earth being conquered. Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), and Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) must defeat the warriors of ruthless Outworld Emperor Shang Tsung (Chin Han).This is a violent, hard-R reboot of the video game adaptation from the 90's. It has scraped off the cheese and speckled on some more action. The special effects are mostly up to date. It's very competent like the competent acting, action, and designs. The story is basic and set up to have more movies in the franchise. Josh Lawson is funny as Kano. The others are less charismatic. The missing ingredient is an A-list actor or an old action star doing a side role cameo. It's an old Hollywood trick but it works. It would give this the illusion of an A-list movie. As it stands, this is a well made B-movie and it's probably enough to continue as a B-movie franchise. Sadly, that road is usually downhill but maybe it could be a long ride.",

Permalink",300,445,7,"The good: the story mostly works, the characterizations are insanely good (from costumes to personalities), and the movie is as gory and brutal as needed, actually way funnier than expected, and the CGI for the powers really great.The bad: the story is a bit messy, the characters motivations and reactions not always 100% natural and/or coherent, and the action and fights (with the exception of the ones with Scorpion) are fine, but the choreography and/or filming is kind of weak (easy to improve with a bigger budget and more talent on board).",

Permalink",534,669,7,"I've seen the older movies of Mortal Kombat, and as cheesy and bad CGI as it was, the fights/tournaments, music, and plots were great. I was excited to see this new movie, and it wasn't that bad, but was still left unsatisfied. I was surprised that I fell in love with Kano; he was charming, hilarious, and prob the best character. Following him, I enjoyed SubZero and his fight scenes. Sonya Blade wasn't too bad too. One character that i had no interest in was the main guy, Cole. He was just boring and unnecessary. Even his ""power"" was....blah. I wish they had Liu Kang as the main guy, his story is more interesting. Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one. Hopefully they bring him back somehow for a better fight in the 2nd movie. If they do, I'm excited to see my boy Johnny Cage!",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",24,30,3,"Even by the standards of films based on video games this is not good. I've played the games since MK2 so I know the franchise has a stupid story but since the film seems happy taking some big liberties with it it should have been made better, not worse (who TF is the main character anyway and why is his super power having an armoured shirt- there are 80 character on the MK roster there was no need to create Cole blandy Mcbland face).The historical intro of the film is actually not bad but after that the film's watchability dives off a cliff. I've already mentioned that the story is dumb so it's a cardinal sin that large parts of the movie are also boring. The acting (Apart from Scorpion/Sub Zero/Shang Tsung) is awful, nothing really connects, there is no reason to care about Cole or his boring family, everything is all of a sudden far too easy in the end and all that went before is pretty pointless. Even the fight scenes are not particularly good. I really did not like this.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",372,489,7,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",35,48,4,"People giving this movie a 6+ needs to surely either evaluate their tastes or look deep within themselves to understand what they like in movies. Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that they had to find their ""Arcana"" which is some fantasy power move like a Marvel superhero similar to Animality from the 97' MK movie. This movie was a mess with the very small portion of cool video game reference scenery that would make people cheer.Funniest plot idea to me was that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TOURNAMENT. Yes, you heard me. They never got to the tournament, its only fighting the ""bad guy"" before the tournament (Which is against the rules) and Rayden choosing to let it happen because of the Elder gods rules. Which ultimately leads to Kung Lao's death (again). Then when Rayden is asked why did he let it happen, he said because he cannot help all souls of Earthrealm. Yet, he is willing to let, ya know, one of his prized fighters on earthrealm die to someone who is killing him outside the rules of the tournament.... Nice.Overall just bad movie. I don't care about the video game accuracy or the cheesy one liners or the bad CGI at certain parts. But this was just a poor movie in almost every aspect and it took energy out of me to watch the rest. This is a fan theory Mortal Kombat with failed college projects vibes to the editing and directing.",Warning: Spoilers

I got my hopes up after the first scene, but it was all downhill from there. Everything is bad. Other than subzero and scorpion, the acting is awful. Like really really bad. Every line or facial expression given by sonya blade is laughable. And the guy playing reiko had a tiny part, but every scene he was in, omg, he had the stupidest hammiest over-the-top facial expressions i've ever seen. (he played rictus erectus!? Lol)the dialogue was terrible, the story was nonsense. Pacing is bad, no flow at all. But the worst part, so much of the fighting was terrible, poorly shot, switching between different fights, and mostly unclear. Why???? Some of the fighting was awesome, so why was the rest of it so bad?They can make an amazing MK movie, i do believe that. I hope they eventually do (1 viewing, 4/24/2021)",

The Opening Sequence is AMAZING!!!The Fight Choreography is great.Hiroyuki Sanada is the BEST Actor in this movie.Sub-Zero actually feels very threatening.Cons:
THERE'S NO MORTAL KOMBAT IN THIS MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE!!!!!!WTF is the point of Cole Young? All these amazing original MK characters and the studio says make a new character as the lead. TERRIBLE Decision!!!Lewis Tan is not a good actor especially considering he's the lead! In fact most of the actors either didn't fit their character or weren't trying hard enough.The Dialogue is BAD. Especially when using the lines from the game. Felt so forced!So many wasted characters: Reptile, Goro, Kabal, Kung Lao etc.Liu Kang, Raiden and Jax were all underused.The villains, aside from Sub-Zero, we're very flat and unthreatening.The script is WEAK. They should've scrapped it and started fresh.I was cautiously looking forward to this. I really loved the games as a kid and the trailer looked great! Sadly, the trailer is the best thing about this film. Every decision feels like a misstep. I don't know who decided to not have the MK Tournament but that was such a mistake. The film has no urgency without it and honestly just felt like they were stalling for time the entire film just to set up a sequel. It's like they were checking boxes with each scene with nothing authentic holding it together. You really don't feel anything for the characters outside of Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and Scorpion is only in two scenes. This whole film feels like a missed opportunity. The animated film Scorpion's Revenge is still the best MK adaptation to date. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you but I struggled to keep watching it. 5/10.",

Permalink",25,30,1,"If the aim was to take a dump on the IP and alienate the existing fanbase, good job. If it was to turn people who never engaged with the franchise in any way before, probably even better.Shame on whoever wrote this lazily put together nonsense that has nothing to do with any established storylines, nor manages to tell a sane, internally coherent story if we discount the first, and frankly main issue. I'd say this cliché riddled, phoned in pile of **** manages to find the perfect balance between facepalm and cringe, but no, somehow it breaks both of those scales at the same time.The story starts at roughly the right place, though watching the Shirai Ryu get exterminated by the Lin Kuei feels sort of like Batman's or Spiderman's origin story: overtold. Then the unnecessary ""main character"" is shoehorned in, and you know what, I'd be borderline willing to step past that if he was not a character with no traits. I don't mean he's boring, or vanilla, I literally think that when the character was ""developed"" the writer(s) forgot to come up with a personality.And let's not forget about this ridiculous ""arcana"" concept, that allows iconic characters to do what they do without their established gear or cybernetic implants, or in the most extreme case allow them to magically manifest high-tech cybernetic prostetics. The sheer level of laziness in the writing here is detestable.Shame on the director too, who deserves the same kind of props, I never realized you could get performances out of otherwise talented actors that are stiff, over the top and boring at the same time. ""Give me your best crotchity grandpa with kids on his lawn and dial it up to 12"" must have been a sentence heard daily on set. And when the cast and crew were finally free of this ""genius"" and post production finally started, the sound team suddenly had to start putting up with the daily instruction: ""Now put a sci-fi noise in for that magic event"", while the editors had to work with this: ""Okay, so we dirped hard on the fight coreography, so just chip-chop this scene into sub-second pieces so nobody notices that.""The dumb, campy 90'-ies Mortal Kombat was 12 times better than this lazily slapped together. The one good thing about this being so bad, is that the next reboot (however many decades we might need to wait for it) will have to be a home run. It's a simple recipe: get an iconic cast of characters together, get them to Shang Tsung's island by minute 20 and then do the tournament. Nail the fights, the characters, put in some appropriate character devlopment, a dash of humor and crank the epic to 11 at the end. A blind hamster could do it ;)",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",40,59,7,"Let's set the expectations first. This movie is based on a video game, not a book or a comic. If you are going into the movie expecting an Oscar winning script or Oscar performances from actors, then you will be disappointed.If you are hoping for a decent screenplay based on the video game with good fight scenes, screen adaptions of your favourite characters and improved choreography and CGI compared to previous Mortal Kombat movies, then you will enjoy this movie. Based on those criteria and scoring this movie from an entertainment point of view, I would give it an 7/10 - I would have loved to have heard the original theme from the 1995 movie in this.I personally didn't have high expectations for this movie due to the fact that very few video games have had good screenplay adaptions. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the job the producers have done for this movie.Although I did not know some of the actors, I thought the casting of the characters was perfect and loved seeing the job they did with them. I especially loved the screen adaptions of the characters special moves... they were a joy to behold. Kano was also surprisingly very funny and the producers did a great job including some of the characters catchphrases. The fictional worlds were also impressive looking in the movie.If you are a fan of the Mortal Kombat game, and you enjoyed the 1995 movie, then this movie is definitely for you. If you are looking for a cheesy entertaining movie to watch then you can't really go astray either with this. If neither of those scenarios apply to you then you should probably give this a miss.",

If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.Fight scenes get more rewarding halfway through, closer to the game style.Also, the idea to rotate this film's story around the rivalry between scorpion and sub-zero worked; it gave some background. Maybe the lead protagonist is not that interesting compared to the other characters but he seems necessary to keep the story moving forward.So, this first film does the job and although not everyone from the game is in it, I m sure all the other favorite characters will appear in the next 2 films and I m looking forward to that.6,5/10 good effort bringing the game on film screen.",

I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.I also didn't gravitate towards the newcomer Cole, I felt like he was unnecessary, I understand wanting to do your own thing sometimes but this was not one of those times. He also beats an iconic MK character which rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully we'll see them again.

Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.",

The story is basic and set up to have more movies in the franchise. Josh Lawson is funny as Kano. The others are less charismatic. The missing ingredient is an A-list actor or an old action star doing a side role cameo. It's an old Hollywood trick but it works. It would give this the illusion of an A-list movie.

Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one.

I've already mentioned that the story is dumb so it's a cardinal sin that large parts of the movie are also boring.

Permalink",372,489,7,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",35,48,4,"People giving this movie a 6+ needs to surely either evaluate their tastes or look deep within themselves to understand what they like in movies. Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that they had to find their ""Arcana"" which is some fantasy power move like a Marvel superhero similar to Animality from the 97' MK movie. This movie was a mess with the very small portion of cool video game reference scenery that would make people cheer.Funniest plot idea to me was that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TOURNAMENT. Yes, you heard me. They never got to the tournament, its only fighting the ""bad guy"" before the tournament (Which is against the rules) and Rayden choosing to let it happen because of the Elder gods rules. Which ultimately leads to Kung Lao's death (again). Then when Rayden is asked why did he let it happen, he said because he cannot help all souls of Earthrealm. Yet, he is willing to let, ya know, one of his prized fighters on earthrealm die to someone who is killing him outside the rules of the tournament.... Nice.Overall just bad movie. I don't care about the video game accuracy or the cheesy one liners or the bad CGI at certain parts.

They should've scrapped it and started fresh.I was cautiously looking forward to this. I really loved the games as a kid and the trailer looked great! Sadly, the trailer is the best thing about this film. Every decision feels like a misstep. I don't know who decided to not have the MK Tournament but that was such a mistake. The film has no urgency without it and honestly just felt like they were stalling for time the entire film just to set up a sequel. It's like they were checking boxes with each scene with nothing authentic holding it together. You really don't feel anything for the characters outside of Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and Scorpion is only in two scenes. This whole film feels like a missed opportunity. The animated film Scorpion's Revenge is still the best MK adaptation to date. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you but I struggled to keep watching it. 5/10.",

If it was to turn people who never engaged with the franchise in any way before, probably even better.Shame on whoever wrote this lazily put together nonsense that has nothing to do with any established storylines, nor manages to tell a sane, internally coherent story if we discount the first, and frankly main issue. I'd say this cliché riddled, phoned in pile of **** manages to find the perfect balance between facepalm and cringe, but no, somehow it breaks both of those scales at the same time.The story starts at roughly the right place, though watching the Shirai Ryu get exterminated by the Lin Kuei feels sort of like Batman's or Spiderman's origin story: overtold. Then the unnecessary ""main character"" is shoehorned in, and you know what, I'd be borderline willing to step past that if he was not a character with no traits. I don't mean he's boring, or vanilla, I literally think that when the character was ""developed"" the writer(s) forgot to come up with a personality.And let's not forget about this ridiculous ""arcana"" concept, that allows iconic characters to do what they do without their established gear or cybernetic implants, or in the most extreme case allow them to magically manifest high-tech cybernetic prostetics. The sheer level of laziness in the writing here is detestable.Shame on the director too, who deserves the same kind of props, I never realized you could get performances out of otherwise talented actors that are stiff, over the top and boring at the same time.

And when the cast and crew were finally free of this ""genius"" and post production finally started, the sound team suddenly had to start putting up with the daily instruction: ""Now put a sci-fi noise in for that magic event"", while the editors had to work with this: ""Okay, so we dirped hard on the fight coreography, so just chip-chop this scene into sub-second pieces so nobody notices that.""The dumb, campy 90'-ies Mortal Kombat was 12 times better than this lazily slapped together. The one good thing about this being so bad, is that the next reboot (however many decades we might need to wait for it) will have to be a home run. It's a simple recipe: get an iconic cast of characters together, get them to Shang Tsung's island by minute 20 and then do the tournament. Nail the fights, the characters, put in some appropriate character devlopment, a dash of humor and crank the epic to 11 at the end. A blind hamster could do it ;)",Warning: Spoilers

It's gory and now that I'm a bit older it can be hard to watch but I knew what to expect going in. All in all MK had great fight scenes, so-so character development and tons of nostalgia. You can't go into these movies thinking they will be Oscar worthy or you'll be disappointed.As they said in Gladiator - I was, in fact, quite entertained and am looking forward to the next one!",

Permalink",40,59,7,"Let's set the expectations first. This movie is based on a video game, not a book or a comic. If you are going into the movie expecting an Oscar winning script or Oscar performances from actors, then you will be disappointed.If you are hoping for a decent screenplay based on the video game with good fight scenes, screen adaptions of your favourite characters and improved choreography and CGI compared to previous Mortal Kombat movies, then you will enjoy this movie. Based on those criteria and scoring this movie from an entertainment point of view, I would give it an 7/10 - I would have loved to have heard the original theme from the 1995 movie in this.I personally didn't have high expectations for this movie due to the fact that very few video games have had good screenplay adaptions. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the job the producers have done for this movie.Although I did not know some of the actors, I thought the casting of the characters was perfect and loved seeing the job they did with them. I especially loved the screen adaptions of the characters special moves... they were a joy to behold. Kano was also surprisingly very funny and the producers did a great job including some of the characters catchphrases. The fictional worlds were also impressive looking in the movie.If you are a fan of the Mortal Kombat game, and you enjoyed the 1995 movie, then this movie is definitely for you. If you are looking for a cheesy entertaining movie to watch then you can't really go astray either with this. If neither of those scenarios apply to you then you should probably give this a miss.",

Permalink",103,171,10,"I see a lot of people talking about the lack of certain things like the actual tournament, to much groundwork on background for certain characters and other characters completely missing from the movie, characters not looking the same etc, as well as people saying they wish there had been more action than only about 40-50% of the movie.I just want to point out to everyone that is not aware, that this is supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy (Yes, I am one of those people that follows stuff like that). Had they packed all of that into one movie it would have been overload.I personally think it was an excellent start! Excellent character casting and personality building on everyone. I love all the visual, Outworld and the temple on Earth. As well as all the visual hints in the movie of future character's for those of us that are a little obsessive.I like the music upgrades, they still have the feel of the original and bring back memories with a slightly more contemporary vibe to keep it from sounding dated. Crossing my fingers that this first installment does well enough so that the next installment goes ahead. The only reason that I am worried that it may not is because of everything thats happened over the past year, not because of the movie not being good enough.I personally loved this movie, as the first of a trilogy. If it were a stand alone I may be a little disappointed that certain personal favorites *cough* Katana *cough* Nightwolf *cough* were not in it, however, I saw Katana's blade fan in the temple although it didn't get a neon sign the way Shinnok's amulet did when Kano tried to steal it, and one of the newspaper clippings on Sonya Blade's research wall pointed to a possibility for a future Nightwolf to me. But between those hints and the big hint (blazing neon sign really lol) at the end when Cole Young heads to Hollywood and as he leaves a movie poster for Johnny Cage as Citizen Cage is left in focus of the camera spell out for some excellent future possibilities/probabilities. They would have had to include other realms in this movie to pull in characters like Katana and again, that probably would have been information overload for one movie. They are taking their time and doing this right and I for one appreciate it greatly!Looking forward to the next installment of this trilogy!",

Shang T-Sung is killing off those who will fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament for Earth.... and we get no tournament??? Really?The introduction to these characters is bad, and the villains are introduced so badly they belong in Mortal Kombat: Anhilation. Yes. Its that Bad! Shang T-Sung literally says each of his henchman names so the audience knows who they are... all located on a terrible bridge of some sort.The movie becomes a train wreck with just about every decision it makes.

Always considering the nature of the movie that is.This is not Shakespeare, this is not meant to have a big story. Bad guys want to destroy the Earth (realm), good guys fight to protect it ... I mean it really is simple as that. The twists and turns can be guessed or seen at least most of the time ... but the movie is entertaining nevertheless.

It makes me want to view the original again. Why was Raiden so different? Some characters like Johnny Cage missing and others added like other reviewers stated like maim character not good.

Permalink",30,51,4,"'ve seen so many reviews of this movie that seem to take great enjoyment making fun of it and saying things like, ""Who cares about a Mortal Kombat movie?""Well, I do. I'm the exact audience for this movie, someone who fell in love with the game, saw both of the original films in the theater and have purchased more than my fair share of the multiple sequels and all the DLC that goes with them.So while these holier than thou critics snicker their way through their reviews, please know that this is someone hoping Stryker would show up and someone that grinded to get multiple Scorpion outfits in Mortal Kombat 11.That means that when I mention all the moments why this movie didn't work, it's with sadness.That's because I've been waiting - as have many fans of the game - for this movie for a long time.And this isn't what I was waiting for.Now, there's the blood and gore that some see as the true heart of Mortal Kombat, but for me, the true joy of the games is the opportunity to be part of a wuxia movie. That would seem to be an incredibly simple idea to take and make a movie of - hey, they did it right the first time - and yet, this doesn't seem to do it.Yes, the Mortal Kombat tournament doesn't happen in every game, but the story has always revolved around it. Much like every shared universe attempt, this is a movie trying to make the sequel instead of worrying about making the first movie rock.The other critical error this movie makes is that outdated thought that we need a set of human eyes to view these events through, someone we can relate to. That would be Cole Young, a struggling MMA artist who has a family bloodline that ties to Scorpion. This is also kind of like how old comics thought that I needed a child sidekick to better identify with Batman. Nope. I'm just fine with wanting to be the hero and even better with unworldly characters that allow me to escape the world of normlacy.Speaking of the gray ordinary world, this movie seems content to have the action take place outside a farmhouse than taking us to the Outworld or really anywhere that isn't drab. Look, I'm not expecting this to be Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, but come on. The beginning at least flirts with bright colors and great fighting. And then...That said, I kind of liked that Tadanobu Asano - Kakihara from Ichi the Killer - was Raiden, even if he doesn't get all that much to do. Josh Lawson's Kano is one of the few other bright spots, even if this version just has a red eye and isn't a cyborg. And I'm always happy to see Kabal.But you know, the first film in what may be a new series gets rid of Goro and Sub-Zero before we even get to the tournament, while tickling us with a mention of Johnny Cage. It's the inverse of Patton Oswald's joke about the Star Wars prequels - ""Don't show me how the things I love started, show me the things I love!"" - and like some weird edging thing where they withhold the sure thing in the hopes of getting you to care more about a movie that might never get made instead of the one you paid to watch.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",66,111,5,"I will start with the positive. The opening and closing scenes of this film are excellent!Focusing on Scorpion and Sub-zero's story was a solid high point that showcased the best this film had to offer as far as acting performances, fight choreography and interesting plot premise.Unfortunately, the 90+ minutes that occur between these 2 scenes are dull in comparison!Immediately after the exhilarating opening scene, we get introduced to brand new character; Cole Young.As a character, Cole is just blah! Boring. Un-interesting. A down-and-out underdog with no real purpose other than functioning as a major buzz-kill everytime he's on screen.Basically - Cole sucks!!!If the writers wanted to add a new character - at least make him interesting so the audience gives a s*!t about him!I would love to say that Cole is the worst thing about this film but unfortunately the ""bad"" doesn't end with him.Other MK faves are pointlessly inserted throughout the film just so the audience can say ""hey, it's Kabal - there he is"" or ""ooh, no! Here comes Goro"" but serve no real purpose outside of this!Rayden and Shang Tsung literally could have been played by anyone!They had NO personality whatsoever!Rayden could barely speak english and delivered his dialogue like it was a dress rehearsal for an amature theatre production.Shang Tsung was a generic TV villain straight out of Power Rangers!No black contact lenses could make up for the lack of ""menace"" about him.This film desperately needed Cary Tagawa back in the role of Shang Tsung - his charisma and menacing grimace was a stand-out of the 1995 original film.Heck - his performance was so good that they bought him back for MK11!Why not this film?!Outside of Sub-zero and Scorpion - the only likeable character in this film is Kano!He gets the best dialogue of all characters (I suspect much of it is improvised), had he not been in the film - that 90 minutes between the intro and ending would have been an absolute snore-fest!I realise I'm sounding overly harsh here but the thing is - Im a long time MK fan.I grew up with the original game trilogy, read the comics and watched the film's.I'm an MK fan for life and this film was an insult to MK fans everywhere!People say we need to turn our brain's off to enjoy these types of film's - but there's a difference between turning off your brain and having to get a labotomy to enjoy a movie!Very dissapointing.I hope that a sequel brings in a new team of (creative) writers, a more competent Director and that they kill off Cole within Act 1 as it would be a huge disservice having a non-canon plank of wood win the tournament!",

Permalink",81,130,10,"I'm by no means a Mortal Kombat expert but it was one of my favorite games to play as a kid, back on a Super Nintendo! 😳 But I have also enjoyed playing the newer MK games on newer devices as well. The games now are very graphic, and the movie delivers on that as well. I love that the characters say lines from the game like ""Flawless Victory"" and ""Kano wins!"" I really don't understand why anyone watching it would be upset with that. Have you guys ever even played the game? Kano was hilarious. I did want a little more from Mileena. Scorpion and Sub Zero were amazing! Great fight scenes! I'd definitely recommend this movie.",

But it was a great MORTAL KOMBAT movie.Full disclosure, I'm a big fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise. I've been playing the video games since the 90's and I am 100% the target demographic for this movie. If you are like me, you will enjoy the movie. If you are not like me, you probably won't (nor should you).Watching the movie is like you're experiencing a playthrough of a new MK game on story mode. All dialogue just serves as a filler between fight scenes. I love the hard R rating that allows the film to embrace the brutality of the violence that is the signature of the series.There are a ton of nods throughout the film to insider fans.Again, in summation: not a good movie. But a GREAT Mortal Kombat movie. Take that for what you will.",

Permalink",266,300,6,"Great visuals, excellent fight scenes, good choices on most of the cast (e.g Kano, Scorpion, Sub-Zero) and just a fun movie overall. If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.Fight scenes get more rewarding halfway through, closer to the game style.Also, the idea to rotate this film's story around the rivalry between scorpion and sub-zero worked; it gave some background. Maybe the lead protagonist is not that interesting compared to the other characters but he seems necessary to keep the story moving forward.So, this first film does the job and although not everyone from the game is in it, I m sure all the other favorite characters will appear in the next 2 films and I m looking forward to that.6,5/10 good effort bringing the game on film screen.",

Grittier to begin with and Hiroyuki Sanada is one of those guys who automatically lifts the quality of the thing by his presence alone, but then it ends up turning into the usual CGI dominated cheese fest by the climax. They try to make sense of some kind of plot here which is quite excruciating but by the end it's just the usual intercutting of heavily stylised fights between the player characters.

The acting was also really good, with Joe Taslim as Subzero being the highlight for me. I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.I also didn't gravitate towards the newcomer Cole, I felt like he was unnecessary, I understand wanting to do your own thing sometimes but this was not one of those times. He also beats an iconic MK character which rubbed me the wrong way, but hopefully we'll see them again. The opening is brilliant and the second act is solid, but it's final act is very rushed and leaves you with little time to take it all in.

Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.",

Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), and Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) must defeat the warriors of ruthless Outworld Emperor Shang Tsung (Chin Han).This is a violent, hard-R reboot of the video game adaptation from the 90's. It has scraped off the cheese and speckled on some more action. The special effects are mostly up to date. It's very competent like the competent acting, action, and designs. The story is basic and set up to have more movies in the franchise. Josh Lawson is funny as Kano. The others are less charismatic. The missing ingredient is an A-list actor or an old action star doing a side role cameo. It's an old Hollywood trick but it works. It would give this the illusion of an A-list movie.

Even his ""power"" was....blah. I wish they had Liu Kang as the main guy, his story is more interesting. Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one. Hopefully they bring him back somehow for a better fight in the 2nd movie. If they do, I'm excited to see my boy Johnny Cage!",Warning: Spoilers

I've already mentioned that the story is dumb so it's a cardinal sin that large parts of the movie are also boring. The acting (Apart from Scorpion/Sub Zero/Shang Tsung) is awful, nothing really connects, there is no reason to care about Cole or his boring family, everything is all of a sudden far too easy in the end and all that went before is pretty pointless.

Permalink",372,489,7,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",35,48,4,"People giving this movie a 6+ needs to surely either evaluate their tastes or look deep within themselves to understand what they like in movies. Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that they had to find their ""Arcana"" which is some fantasy power move like a Marvel superhero similar to Animality from the 97' MK movie. This movie was a mess with the very small portion of cool video game reference scenery that would make people cheer.Funniest plot idea to me was that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TOURNAMENT. Yes, you heard me. They never got to the tournament, its only fighting the ""bad guy"" before the tournament (Which is against the rules) and Rayden choosing to let it happen because of the Elder gods rules. Which ultimately leads to Kung Lao's death (again). Then when Rayden is asked why did he let it happen, he said because he cannot help all souls of Earthrealm. Yet, he is willing to let, ya know, one of his prized fighters on earthrealm die to someone who is killing him outside the rules of the tournament.... Nice.Overall just bad movie. I don't care about the video game accuracy or the cheesy one liners or the bad CGI at certain parts. But this was just a poor movie in almost every aspect and it took energy out of me to watch the rest.

The Opening Sequence is AMAZING!!!The Fight Choreography is great.Hiroyuki Sanada is the BEST Actor in this movie.Sub-Zero actually feels very threatening.Cons:
THERE'S NO MORTAL KOMBAT IN THIS MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE!!!!!!WTF is the point of Cole Young? All these amazing original MK characters and the studio says make a new character as the lead. TERRIBLE Decision!!!Lewis Tan is not a good actor especially considering he's the lead! In fact most of the actors either didn't fit their character or weren't trying hard enough.The Dialogue is BAD. Especially when using the lines from the game. Felt so forced!So many wasted characters: Reptile, Goro, Kabal, Kung Lao etc.Liu Kang, Raiden and Jax were all underused.The villains, aside from Sub-Zero, we're very flat and unthreatening.The script is WEAK. They should've scrapped it and started fresh.I was cautiously looking forward to this. I really loved the games as a kid and the trailer looked great! Sadly, the trailer is the best thing about this film. Every decision feels like a misstep. I don't know who decided to not have the MK Tournament but that was such a mistake. The film has no urgency without it and honestly just felt like they were stalling for time the entire film just to set up a sequel. It's like they were checking boxes with each scene with nothing authentic holding it together. You really don't feel anything for the characters outside of Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and Scorpion is only in two scenes. This whole film feels like a missed opportunity. The animated film Scorpion's Revenge is still the best MK adaptation to date. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you but I struggled to keep watching it. 5/10.",

Permalink",25,30,1,"If the aim was to take a dump on the IP and alienate the existing fanbase, good job. If it was to turn people who never engaged with the franchise in any way before, probably even better.Shame on whoever wrote this lazily put together nonsense that has nothing to do with any established storylines, nor manages to tell a sane, internally coherent story if we discount the first, and frankly main issue. I'd say this cliché riddled, phoned in pile of **** manages to find the perfect balance between facepalm and cringe, but no, somehow it breaks both of those scales at the same time.The story starts at roughly the right place, though watching the Shirai Ryu get exterminated by the Lin Kuei feels sort of like Batman's or Spiderman's origin story: overtold. Then the unnecessary ""main character"" is shoehorned in, and you know what, I'd be borderline willing to step past that if he was not a character with no traits. I don't mean he's boring, or vanilla, I literally think that when the character was ""developed"" the writer(s) forgot to come up with a personality.And let's not forget about this ridiculous ""arcana"" concept, that allows iconic characters to do what they do without their established gear or cybernetic implants, or in the most extreme case allow them to magically manifest high-tech cybernetic prostetics. The sheer level of laziness in the writing here is detestable.Shame on the director too, who deserves the same kind of props, I never realized you could get performances out of otherwise talented actors that are stiff, over the top and boring at the same time. ""Give me your best crotchity grandpa with kids on his lawn and dial it up to 12"" must have been a sentence heard daily on set. And when the cast and crew were finally free of this ""genius"" and post production finally started, the sound team suddenly had to start putting up with the daily instruction: ""Now put a sci-fi noise in for that magic event"", while the editors had to work with this: ""Okay, so we dirped hard on the fight coreography, so just chip-chop this scene into sub-second pieces so nobody notices that.""The dumb, campy 90'-ies Mortal Kombat was 12 times better than this lazily slapped together. The one good thing about this being so bad, is that the next reboot (however many decades we might need to wait for it) will have to be a home run. It's a simple recipe: get an iconic cast of characters together, get them to Shang Tsung's island by minute 20 and then do the tournament. Nail the fights, the characters, put in some appropriate character devlopment, a dash of humor and crank the epic to 11 at the end. A blind hamster could do it ;)",Warning: Spoilers

It's gory and now that I'm a bit older it can be hard to watch but I knew what to expect going in. All in all MK had great fight scenes, so-so character development and tons of nostalgia.

Permalink",40,59,7,"Let's set the expectations first. This movie is based on a video game, not a book or a comic. If you are going into the movie expecting an Oscar winning script or Oscar performances from actors, then you will be disappointed.If you are hoping for a decent screenplay based on the video game with good fight scenes, screen adaptions of your favourite characters and improved choreography and CGI compared to previous Mortal Kombat movies, then you will enjoy this movie. Based on those criteria and scoring this movie from an entertainment point of view, I would give it an 7/10 - I would have loved to have heard the original theme from the 1995 movie in this.I personally didn't have high expectations for this movie due to the fact that very few video games have had good screenplay adaptions. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the job the producers have done for this movie.Although I did not know some of the actors, I thought the casting of the characters was perfect and loved seeing the job they did with them. I especially loved the screen adaptions of the characters special moves... they were a joy to behold. Kano was also surprisingly very funny and the producers did a great job including some of the characters catchphrases. The fictional worlds were also impressive looking in the movie.If you are a fan of the Mortal Kombat game, and you enjoyed the 1995 movie, then this movie is definitely for you. If you are looking for a cheesy entertaining movie to watch then you can't really go astray either with this. If neither of those scenarios apply to you then you should probably give this a miss.",

Permalink",103,171,10,"I see a lot of people talking about the lack of certain things like the actual tournament, to much groundwork on background for certain characters and other characters completely missing from the movie, characters not looking the same etc, as well as people saying they wish there had been more action than only about 40-50% of the movie.I just want to point out to everyone that is not aware, that this is supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy (Yes, I am one of those people that follows stuff like that). Had they packed all of that into one movie it would have been overload.I personally think it was an excellent start! Excellent character casting and personality building on everyone. I love all the visual, Outworld and the temple on Earth. As well as all the visual hints in the movie of future character's for those of us that are a little obsessive.I like the music upgrades, they still have the feel of the original and bring back memories with a slightly more contemporary vibe to keep it from sounding dated. Crossing my fingers that this first installment does well enough so that the next installment goes ahead. The only reason that I am worried that it may not is because of everything thats happened over the past year, not because of the movie not being good enough.I personally loved this movie, as the first of a trilogy. If it were a stand alone I may be a little disappointed that certain personal favorites *cough* Katana *cough* Nightwolf *cough* were not in it, however, I saw Katana's blade fan in the temple although it didn't get a neon sign the way Shinnok's amulet did when Kano tried to steal it, and one of the newspaper clippings on Sonya Blade's research wall pointed to a possibility for a future Nightwolf to me. But between those hints and the big hint (blazing neon sign really lol) at the end when Cole Young heads to Hollywood and as he leaves a movie poster for Johnny Cage as Citizen Cage is left in focus of the camera spell out for some excellent future possibilities/probabilities. They would have had to include other realms in this movie to pull in characters like Katana and again, that probably would have been information overload for one movie. They are taking their time and doing this right and I for one appreciate it greatly!Looking forward to the next installment of this trilogy!",

I guess New Line figured if it could contain blood and gore it would succeed, but even that is lackluster here.There is 25 to 30 years worth of Mortal Kombat games and backstories to choose from and yet they introduce a brand new character named Cole who adds nothing to the film other than figuring out he can grow a poor man's version of Aquamans top.The plot is weak. Shang T-Sung is killing off those who will fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament for Earth.... and we get no tournament??? Really?The introduction to these characters is bad, and the villains are introduced so badly they belong in Mortal Kombat: Anhilation. Yes. Its that Bad! Shang T-Sung literally says each of his henchman names so the audience knows who they are... all located on a terrible bridge of some sort.The movie becomes a train wreck with just about every decision it makes.

That does not mean you will like it - but hopefully you will like this one. The action is really good (and quite violent just so you know), the acting is also more than solid, which includes script and dialog. Always considering the nature of the movie that is.This is not Shakespeare, this is not meant to have a big story. Bad guys want to destroy the Earth (realm), good guys fight to protect it ... I mean it really is simple as that. The twists and turns can be guessed or seen at least most of the time ... but the movie is entertaining nevertheless.

Permalink",30,51,4,"'ve seen so many reviews of this movie that seem to take great enjoyment making fun of it and saying things like, ""Who cares about a Mortal Kombat movie?""Well, I do. I'm the exact audience for this movie, someone who fell in love with the game, saw both of the original films in the theater and have purchased more than my fair share of the multiple sequels and all the DLC that goes with them.So while these holier than thou critics snicker their way through their reviews, please know that this is someone hoping Stryker would show up and someone that grinded to get multiple Scorpion outfits in Mortal Kombat 11.That means that when I mention all the moments why this movie didn't work, it's with sadness.That's because I've been waiting - as have many fans of the game - for this movie for a long time.And this isn't what I was waiting for.Now, there's the blood and gore that some see as the true heart of Mortal Kombat, but for me, the true joy of the games is the opportunity to be part of a wuxia movie. That would seem to be an incredibly simple idea to take and make a movie of - hey, they did it right the first time - and yet, this doesn't seem to do it.Yes, the Mortal Kombat tournament doesn't happen in every game, but the story has always revolved around it. Much like every shared universe attempt, this is a movie trying to make the sequel instead of worrying about making the first movie rock.The other critical error this movie makes is that outdated thought that we need a set of human eyes to view these events through, someone we can relate to. That would be Cole Young, a struggling MMA artist who has a family bloodline that ties to Scorpion. This is also kind of like how old comics thought that I needed a child sidekick to better identify with Batman. Nope. I'm just fine with wanting to be the hero and even better with unworldly characters that allow me to escape the world of normlacy.Speaking of the gray ordinary world, this movie seems content to have the action take place outside a farmhouse than taking us to the Outworld or really anywhere that isn't drab. Look, I'm not expecting this to be Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, but come on. The beginning at least flirts with bright colors and great fighting. And then...That said, I kind of liked that Tadanobu Asano - Kakihara from Ichi the Killer - was Raiden, even if he doesn't get all that much to do. Josh Lawson's Kano is one of the few other bright spots, even if this version just has a red eye and isn't a cyborg. And I'm always happy to see Kabal.But you know, the first film in what may be a new series gets rid of Goro and Sub-Zero before we even get to the tournament, while tickling us with a mention of Johnny Cage. It's the inverse of Patton Oswald's joke about the Star Wars prequels - ""Don't show me how the things I love started, show me the things I love!"" - and like some weird edging thing where they withhold the sure thing in the hopes of getting you to care more about a movie that might never get made instead of the one you paid to watch.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",66,111,5,"I will start with the positive. The opening and closing scenes of this film are excellent!Focusing on Scorpion and Sub-zero's story was a solid high point that showcased the best this film had to offer as far as acting performances, fight choreography and interesting plot premise.Unfortunately, the 90+ minutes that occur between these 2 scenes are dull in comparison!Immediately after the exhilarating opening scene, we get introduced to brand new character; Cole Young.As a character, Cole is just blah! Boring. Un-interesting. A down-and-out underdog with no real purpose other than functioning as a major buzz-kill everytime he's on screen.Basically - Cole sucks!!!If the writers wanted to add a new character - at least make him interesting so the audience gives a s*!t about him!I would love to say that Cole is the worst thing about this film but unfortunately the ""bad"" doesn't end with him.Other MK faves are pointlessly inserted throughout the film just so the audience can say ""hey, it's Kabal - there he is"" or ""ooh, no! Here comes Goro"" but serve no real purpose outside of this!Rayden and Shang Tsung literally could have been played by anyone!They had NO personality whatsoever!Rayden could barely speak english and delivered his dialogue like it was a dress rehearsal for an amature theatre production.Shang Tsung was a generic TV villain straight out of Power Rangers!No black contact lenses could make up for the lack of ""menace"" about him.This film desperately needed Cary Tagawa back in the role of Shang Tsung - his charisma and menacing grimace was a stand-out of the 1995 original film.Heck - his performance was so good that they bought him back for MK11!Why not this film?!Outside of Sub-zero and Scorpion - the only likeable character in this film is Kano!He gets the best dialogue of all characters (I suspect much of it is improvised), had he not been in the film - that 90 minutes between the intro and ending would have been an absolute snore-fest!I realise I'm sounding overly harsh here but the thing is - Im a long time MK fan.I grew up with the original game trilogy, read the comics and watched the film's.I'm an MK fan for life and this film was an insult to MK fans everywhere!People say we need to turn our brain's off to enjoy these types of film's - but there's a difference between turning off your brain and having to get a labotomy to enjoy a movie!Very dissapointing.I hope that a sequel brings in a new team of (creative) writers, a more competent Director and that they kill off Cole within Act 1 as it would be a huge disservice having a non-canon plank of wood win the tournament!",

But it was a great MORTAL KOMBAT movie.Full disclosure, I'm a big fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise. I've been playing the video games since the 90's and I am 100% the target demographic for this movie. If you are like me, you will enjoy the movie. If you are not like me, you probably won't (nor should you).Watching the movie is like you're experiencing a playthrough of a new MK game on story mode. All dialogue just serves as a filler between fight scenes. I love the hard R rating that allows the film to embrace the brutality of the violence that is the signature of the series.There are a ton of nods throughout the film to insider fans.Again, in summation: not a good movie. But a GREAT Mortal Kombat movie. Take that for what you will.",

Permalink",3,3,3,"I don't care about rebooting franchises or even standalone movies; I really think art reinvents itself with each iteration, and a movie from the '90s, for example, can be reimagined for the 20s of the third millennium.Even so, Mortal Kombat (2021) disappoints. In this reboot, the producers put too much care into the fan service and forgot about the story in general. What we get is a shallow film with several forced references to the game.We begin the film with a prologue about the feud between Subzero and Scorpion. The prologue makes room for the main character who, for some reason, the writers decided to be a new character, out of the range of possible fighters already existing in the franchise.There's not much setup for the second act. Cole Young struggles, literally, to put money into the house while suffering from self-doubt. Then a guy shows up after Cole takes a beating, Subzero decides to be a pain, and that's it, we're already in the second act. ""Hey! You and I have the same body mark. Look for Sonya Blade.""Without getting into spoilers, the most I can say is that the film is a sequence of disjointed references and bad jokes with some choreographed fights. The plot itself is simplistic and monotonous, a search for such an inner Arcana that makes room for a lot of deus ex machina.The ending is pretty pointless too, making room for the already planned sequences.I can only say that it's not a film I recommend. Mortal Kombat doesn't live up to expectations, looking more like a fan-based movie that tries to be cool than actually a reboot.Attention! From here on out, some spoilers:The film's biggest flaw is that the actual Mortal Kombat doesn't even happen. The whole plot is Shang Tsung trying to kill the heroes of the earthly plane before the tournament. The idea is that trying to kill them before the tournament might catch them off guard, but it's such a weak concept that it is infuriating.The arcs of the characters are to discover their inner Arcane. The film raises this concept that all the heroes of Earth possess this Arcane that, when revealed, unleashes its magic. This magic system is very shallow, a dumb explanation of how the game's characters release fireballs or laser beams from their eyes. This system seems like lazy writing, an excuse not to think of better backstories for the universe.And finally, Cole Young. Nothing against a new character to the franchise, but Cole's arc is generic and bland. His Arcane is an armor with melee weapons, so convenient that it hurts. Cole Young could easily be Johnny Cage.",

Permalink",3,3,5,"Mortal Kombat tries its best to be a multi-movie film franchise, but sacrifices quality storytelling in favor of stretching out an origin film to start the franchise. While you can tell that most of the cast is having fun with their roles, they are all weakened by the film focusing on the wrong character. Cole was probably chosen for the focus to give an underdog tale with heart at the center, but it only periodically remembers that and instead Cole is treated as a punching bag that constantly needs to be bailed out by more worthy characters. This draws these plots out longer than it needs and then quickly wraps up the film in a 30ish minute montage, then lets another character wrap up their own redemption arc before ending on a cliffhanger which may never get resolved. Mortal Kombat had bitten off more than they could chew and they choked it out in a disappointing fashion. Excellent cast, visually stunning, but holds itself back by trying to be too much.",Warning: Spoilers

If you need to have the movie be so accurate, you're better off playing the video games.And even the video games contradict themselves, most prominently since MK 10, where it seems they have gradually discredited MK: Deception, Sub Zero Mythologies, MK: Armageddon and some aspects of MK9.Although, the movie follows in the vein of MK9 and humanizes the plot by adding a new character, complete with some backstory and background.No new ground was broken with character development and it doesn't need to when we have played the 20 different games there are on the subject.The fatalities and gore FINALLY have made it onto the big screen and for that, I commend the filmmakers and their ear for fan service.The dialogue was less contrived than the first 2 movies and the witty Kano, who is usually despised by your average MK fan, was a delightful surprise.He really helped move the already awkward dialogue and deadpan performances along.For me, it was worth the ill advised trip to the theater.

Permalink",26,44,9,"To summarize: this movie accomplishes what it intended to. It's a more graphic, modern, and cinematic take on the games content. It builds a loose plot line to allow for multiple fights while essentially serving as a prologue to future potential sequels or movies.Pros:
Graphic content, Delivers what you expect, Scorpion Vs Sub-Zero driving the plot line, easy to follow, multiple fights, and distinguishes itself from old movies.Cons:
Struggled to create a climatic fight sequence like old films where they progressed to a boss, cussing was ok but almost became unnecessary at times like it was being forced, acting took some time to adjust to, fights weren't very long (but did allow for more), and missed out on the epic fight music keying in at the right times.Final thoughts:
It's a movie converted from a game and should be treated as such. Not-so-serious entertainment that gives exactly whats expected of if with room to flourish with sequels and etc if properly managed. The story behind Cole young surprisingly didn't suck either and neither did the movie as long as you keep it in perspective of what exactly it is (a gaming fans movie).",

If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.Keep in mind that it's a trilogy, so this first film tries to add some background! Luckily there's not much time spent on meaningless conversations and the scenes get into the action parts faster than you would expect. Runtime of 1h 50min is works well; you will not be bored.Fight scenes get more rewarding halfway through, closer to the game style.Also, the idea to rotate this film's story around the rivalry between scorpion and sub-zero worked; it gave some background. Maybe the lead protagonist is not that interesting compared to the other characters but he seems necessary to keep the story moving forward.So, this first film does the job and although not everyone from the game is in it, I m sure all the other favorite characters will appear in the next 2 films and I m looking forward to that.6,5/10 good effort bringing the game on film screen.",

He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.There are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you're looking at characters interacting and in the next you're looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I'll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,If you know what you're getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn't gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you're expecting more then it's gonna be a letdown.",

The story is basic and set up to have more movies in the franchise. Josh Lawson is funny as Kano. The others are less charismatic. The missing ingredient is an A-list actor or an old action star doing a side role cameo. It's an old Hollywood trick but it works. It would give this the illusion of an A-list movie.

Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one.

Permalink",372,489,7,"I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.Now the big elephant in the room, Cole Young. Adding a new character isn't that bad, but a new protagonist... that's an entire different thing. It's a very risky move, mostly because not only shatters the whole storyline, but also because a main character needs to be likeable to the general audience in order to stand. Personally, I found him closer to indifferent than good or bad, just kind of there. Fortunatly we can see that at the end, there's an intention to bring Johny Cage, who should already be present nonetheless along with Kitana (how can we have Mileena without Kitana?).Also there were some unecessary scenes, like Nitara (totally random choice by the way) literally appearing on screen just to die in the following second, following the footsteps of Rain in MK Anihalation. One way to get around that and other unsuited scene changes would be to increase the movie's lenght or simply not screening the character at all.On the upside, Kano's role is incredibly well performed and gives the movie its whole humour, bringing balance and a reality feeling to it. The fighting sequences are good, well shooted from a nice different set of angles, with a lot of movement variety. It's also noticeable they gave enourmous attention to Sub-Zero's special effects, which I think is one the best things in the movie along with some easter eggs like Shinnok's Amulet or Kitana's Fan. Goro's animation is also on a good note.Last but not least, the final standoff between Scorpion and Sub-Zero didn't let down. Very well shooted with an original choreography, and still managing to be loyal to some of the most iconic original moves from the game characters.To summarize, it's a generally well done remake. Although needing a lot of work, mostly on actor's performance and argument, has potential to set the foundations for an upcoming cinematic universe to be explored, which after all these years, MK absolutely deserves.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",35,48,4,"People giving this movie a 6+ needs to surely either evaluate their tastes or look deep within themselves to understand what they like in movies. Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that they had to find their ""Arcana"" which is some fantasy power move like a Marvel superhero similar to Animality from the 97' MK movie. This movie was a mess with the very small portion of cool video game reference scenery that would make people cheer.Funniest plot idea to me was that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE TOURNAMENT. Yes, you heard me. They never got to the tournament, its only fighting the ""bad guy"" before the tournament (Which is against the rules) and Rayden choosing to let it happen because of the Elder gods rules. Which ultimately leads to Kung Lao's death (again). Then when Rayden is asked why did he let it happen, he said because he cannot help all souls of Earthrealm. Yet, he is willing to let, ya know, one of his prized fighters on earthrealm die to someone who is killing him outside the rules of the tournament.... Nice.Overall just bad movie. I don't care about the video game accuracy or the cheesy one liners or the bad CGI at certain parts.

Especially when using the lines from the game.

They should've scrapped it and started fresh.I was cautiously looking forward to this. I really loved the games as a kid and the trailer looked great! Sadly, the trailer is the best thing about this film. Every decision feels like a misstep. I don't know who decided to not have the MK Tournament but that was such a mistake. The film has no urgency without it and honestly just felt like they were stalling for time the entire film just to set up a sequel. It's like they were checking boxes with each scene with nothing authentic holding it together. You really don't feel anything for the characters outside of Sub-Zero and Scorpion, and Scorpion is only in two scenes. This whole film feels like a missed opportunity. The animated film Scorpion's Revenge is still the best MK adaptation to date. If you enjoyed this film, I'm happy for you but I struggled to keep watching it. 5/10.",

I don't mean he's boring, or vanilla, I literally think that when the character was ""developed"" the writer(s) forgot to come up with a personality.And let's not forget about this ridiculous ""arcana"" concept, that allows iconic characters to do what they do without their established gear or cybernetic implants, or in the most extreme case allow them to magically manifest high-tech cybernetic prostetics. The sheer level of laziness in the writing here is detestable.Shame on the director too, who deserves the same kind of props, I never realized you could get performances out of otherwise talented actors that are stiff, over the top and boring at the same time. ""Give me your best crotchity grandpa with kids on his lawn and dial it up to 12"" must have been a sentence heard daily on set. And when the cast and crew were finally free of this ""genius"" and post production finally started, the sound team suddenly had to start putting up with the daily instruction: ""Now put a sci-fi noise in for that magic event"", while the editors had to work with this: ""Okay, so we dirped hard on the fight coreography, so just chip-chop this scene into sub-second pieces so nobody notices that.""The dumb, campy 90'-ies Mortal Kombat was 12 times better than this lazily slapped together. The one good thing about this being so bad, is that the next reboot (however many decades we might need to wait for it) will have to be a home run. It's a simple recipe: get an iconic cast of characters together, get them to Shang Tsung's island by minute 20 and then do the tournament. Nail the fights, the characters, put in some appropriate character devlopment, a dash of humor and crank the epic to 11 at the end. A blind hamster could do it ;)",Warning: Spoilers

It's gory and now that I'm a bit older it can be hard to watch but I knew what to expect going in. All in all MK had great fight scenes, so-so character development and tons of nostalgia.

Permalink",40,59,7,"Let's set the expectations first. This movie is based on a video game, not a book or a comic. If you are going into the movie expecting an Oscar winning script or Oscar performances from actors, then you will be disappointed.If you are hoping for a decent screenplay based on the video game with good fight scenes, screen adaptions of your favourite characters and improved choreography and CGI compared to previous Mortal Kombat movies, then you will enjoy this movie. Based on those criteria and scoring this movie from an entertainment point of view, I would give it an 7/10 - I would have loved to have heard the original theme from the 1995 movie in this.I personally didn't have high expectations for this movie due to the fact that very few video games have had good screenplay adaptions. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the job the producers have done for this movie.Although I did not know some of the actors, I thought the casting of the characters was perfect and loved seeing the job they did with them. I especially loved the screen adaptions of the characters special moves... they were a joy to behold. Kano was also surprisingly very funny and the producers did a great job including some of the characters catchphrases. The fictional worlds were also impressive looking in the movie.If you are a fan of the Mortal Kombat game, and you enjoyed the 1995 movie, then this movie is definitely for you. If you are looking for a cheesy entertaining movie to watch then you can't really go astray either with this. If neither of those scenarios apply to you then you should probably give this a miss.",

Permalink",103,171,10,"I see a lot of people talking about the lack of certain things like the actual tournament, to much groundwork on background for certain characters and other characters completely missing from the movie, characters not looking the same etc, as well as people saying they wish there had been more action than only about 40-50% of the movie.I just want to point out to everyone that is not aware, that this is supposed to be the beginning of a trilogy (Yes, I am one of those people that follows stuff like that). Had they packed all of that into one movie it would have been overload.I personally think it was an excellent start! Excellent character casting and personality building on everyone. I love all the visual, Outworld and the temple on Earth. As well as all the visual hints in the movie of future character's for those of us that are a little obsessive.I like the music upgrades, they still have the feel of the original and bring back memories with a slightly more contemporary vibe to keep it from sounding dated. Crossing my fingers that this first installment does well enough so that the next installment goes ahead. The only reason that I am worried that it may not is because of everything thats happened over the past year, not because of the movie not being good enough.I personally loved this movie, as the first of a trilogy. If it were a stand alone I may be a little disappointed that certain personal favorites *cough* Katana *cough* Nightwolf *cough* were not in it, however, I saw Katana's blade fan in the temple although it didn't get a neon sign the way Shinnok's amulet did when Kano tried to steal it, and one of the newspaper clippings on Sonya Blade's research wall pointed to a possibility for a future Nightwolf to me. But between those hints and the big hint (blazing neon sign really lol) at the end when Cole Young heads to Hollywood and as he leaves a movie poster for Johnny Cage as Citizen Cage is left in focus of the camera spell out for some excellent future possibilities/probabilities. They would have had to include other realms in this movie to pull in characters like Katana and again, that probably would have been information overload for one movie. They are taking their time and doing this right and I for one appreciate it greatly!Looking forward to the next installment of this trilogy!",

Shang T-Sung is killing off those who will fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament for Earth.... and we get no tournament??? Really?The introduction to these characters is bad, and the villains are introduced so badly they belong in Mortal Kombat: Anhilation. Yes. Its that Bad! Shang T-Sung literally says each of his henchman names so the audience knows who they are... all located on a terrible bridge of some sort.The movie becomes a train wreck with just about every decision it makes.

Permalink",30,51,4,"'ve seen so many reviews of this movie that seem to take great enjoyment making fun of it and saying things like, ""Who cares about a Mortal Kombat movie?""Well, I do. I'm the exact audience for this movie, someone who fell in love with the game, saw both of the original films in the theater and have purchased more than my fair share of the multiple sequels and all the DLC that goes with them.So while these holier than thou critics snicker their way through their reviews, please know that this is someone hoping Stryker would show up and someone that grinded to get multiple Scorpion outfits in Mortal Kombat 11.That means that when I mention all the moments why this movie didn't work, it's with sadness.That's because I've been waiting - as have many fans of the game - for this movie for a long time.And this isn't what I was waiting for.Now, there's the blood and gore that some see as the true heart of Mortal Kombat, but for me, the true joy of the games is the opportunity to be part of a wuxia movie. That would seem to be an incredibly simple idea to take and make a movie of - hey, they did it right the first time - and yet, this doesn't seem to do it.Yes, the Mortal Kombat tournament doesn't happen in every game, but the story has always revolved around it. Much like every shared universe attempt, this is a movie trying to make the sequel instead of worrying about making the first movie rock.The other critical error this movie makes is that outdated thought that we need a set of human eyes to view these events through, someone we can relate to. That would be Cole Young, a struggling MMA artist who has a family bloodline that ties to Scorpion. This is also kind of like how old comics thought that I needed a child sidekick to better identify with Batman. Nope. I'm just fine with wanting to be the hero and even better with unworldly characters that allow me to escape the world of normlacy.Speaking of the gray ordinary world, this movie seems content to have the action take place outside a farmhouse than taking us to the Outworld or really anywhere that isn't drab. Look, I'm not expecting this to be Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, but come on. The beginning at least flirts with bright colors and great fighting. And then...That said, I kind of liked that Tadanobu Asano - Kakihara from Ichi the Killer - was Raiden, even if he doesn't get all that much to do. Josh Lawson's Kano is one of the few other bright spots, even if this version just has a red eye and isn't a cyborg. And I'm always happy to see Kabal.But you know, the first film in what may be a new series gets rid of Goro and Sub-Zero before we even get to the tournament, while tickling us with a mention of Johnny Cage. It's the inverse of Patton Oswald's joke about the Star Wars prequels - ""Don't show me how the things I love started, show me the things I love!"" - and like some weird edging thing where they withhold the sure thing in the hopes of getting you to care more about a movie that might never get made instead of the one you paid to watch.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",66,111,5,"I will start with the positive. The opening and closing scenes of this film are excellent!Focusing on Scorpion and Sub-zero's story was a solid high point that showcased the best this film had to offer as far as acting performances, fight choreography and interesting plot premise.Unfortunately, the 90+ minutes that occur between these 2 scenes are dull in comparison!Immediately after the exhilarating opening scene, we get introduced to brand new character; Cole Young.As a character, Cole is just blah! Boring. Un-interesting. A down-and-out underdog with no real purpose other than functioning as a major buzz-kill everytime he's on screen.Basically - Cole sucks!!!If the writers wanted to add a new character - at least make him interesting so the audience gives a s*!t about him!I would love to say that Cole is the worst thing about this film but unfortunately the ""bad"" doesn't end with him.Other MK faves are pointlessly inserted throughout the film just so the audience can say ""hey, it's Kabal - there he is"" or ""ooh, no! Here comes Goro"" but serve no real purpose outside of this!Rayden and Shang Tsung literally could have been played by anyone!They had NO personality whatsoever!Rayden could barely speak english and delivered his dialogue like it was a dress rehearsal for an amature theatre production.Shang Tsung was a generic TV villain straight out of Power Rangers!No black contact lenses could make up for the lack of ""menace"" about him.This film desperately needed Cary Tagawa back in the role of Shang Tsung - his charisma and menacing grimace was a stand-out of the 1995 original film.Heck - his performance was so good that they bought him back for MK11!Why not this film?!Outside of Sub-zero and Scorpion - the only likeable character in this film is Kano!He gets the best dialogue of all characters (I suspect much of it is improvised), had he not been in the film - that 90 minutes between the intro and ending would have been an absolute snore-fest!I realise I'm sounding overly harsh here but the thing is - Im a long time MK fan.I grew up with the original game trilogy, read the comics and watched the film's.I'm an MK fan for life and this film was an insult to MK fans everywhere!People say we need to turn our brain's off to enjoy these types of film's - but there's a difference between turning off your brain and having to get a labotomy to enjoy a movie!Very dissapointing.I hope that a sequel brings in a new team of (creative) writers, a more competent Director and that they kill off Cole within Act 1 as it would be a huge disservice having a non-canon plank of wood win the tournament!",

Permalink",81,130,10,"I'm by no means a Mortal Kombat expert but it was one of my favorite games to play as a kid, back on a Super Nintendo! 😳 But I have also enjoyed playing the newer MK games on newer devices as well. The games now are very graphic, and the movie delivers on that as well. I love that the characters say lines from the game like ""Flawless Victory"" and ""Kano wins!"" I really don't understand why anyone watching it would be upset with that. Have you guys ever even played the game? Kano was hilarious. I did want a little more from Mileena. Scorpion and Sub Zero were amazing! Great fight scenes! I'd definitely recommend this movie.",

Not the best storyline I've ever encountered, but certainly better than expected.I went in with low expectations and I'm glad to say I was surprised. Considering whats coming out these days, this was one of the more enjoyable movies I've watched over the last year.",

Permalink",36,58,8,"Was this a great movie? No. Was this a good movie? Also, probably, no. Alright... let's be honest, this was a bad movie. But it was a great MORTAL KOMBAT movie.Full disclosure, I'm a big fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise. I've been playing the video games since the 90's and I am 100% the target demographic for this movie. If you are like me, you will enjoy the movie. If you are not like me, you probably won't (nor should you).Watching the movie is like you're experiencing a playthrough of a new MK game on story mode. All dialogue just serves as a filler between fight scenes. I love the hard R rating that allows the film to embrace the brutality of the violence that is the signature of the series.There are a ton of nods throughout the film to insider fans.Again, in summation: not a good movie. But a GREAT Mortal Kombat movie. Take that for what you will.",

It's not going to win an oscar, but i feel like they did a great job with this adaptation. Hope they include Kitana in the sequel.",

Permalink",3,3,3,"I don't care about rebooting franchises or even standalone movies; I really think art reinvents itself with each iteration, and a movie from the '90s, for example, can be reimagined for the 20s of the third millennium.Even so, Mortal Kombat (2021) disappoints. In this reboot, the producers put too much care into the fan service and forgot about the story in general. What we get is a shallow film with several forced references to the game.We begin the film with a prologue about the feud between Subzero and Scorpion. The prologue makes room for the main character who, for some reason, the writers decided to be a new character, out of the range of possible fighters already existing in the franchise.There's not much setup for the second act. Cole Young struggles, literally, to put money into the house while suffering from self-doubt. Then a guy shows up after Cole takes a beating, Subzero decides to be a pain, and that's it, we're already in the second act. ""Hey! You and I have the same body mark. Look for Sonya Blade.""Without getting into spoilers, the most I can say is that the film is a sequence of disjointed references and bad jokes with some choreographed fights. The plot itself is simplistic and monotonous, a search for such an inner Arcana that makes room for a lot of deus ex machina.The ending is pretty pointless too, making room for the already planned sequences.I can only say that it's not a film I recommend. Mortal Kombat doesn't live up to expectations, looking more like a fan-based movie that tries to be cool than actually a reboot.Attention! From here on out, some spoilers:The film's biggest flaw is that the actual Mortal Kombat doesn't even happen. The whole plot is Shang Tsung trying to kill the heroes of the earthly plane before the tournament. The idea is that trying to kill them before the tournament might catch them off guard, but it's such a weak concept that it is infuriating.The arcs of the characters are to discover their inner Arcane. The film raises this concept that all the heroes of Earth possess this Arcane that, when revealed, unleashes its magic. This magic system is very shallow, a dumb explanation of how the game's characters release fireballs or laser beams from their eyes. This system seems like lazy writing, an excuse not to think of better backstories for the universe.And finally, Cole Young. Nothing against a new character to the franchise, but Cole's arc is generic and bland. His Arcane is an armor with melee weapons, so convenient that it hurts. Cole Young could easily be Johnny Cage.",

Permalink",5,6,2,"I got the usual stuff, things and effects. The same old back ground story, the same old dark world vs good earth kind of thing. A selection of characters who have or don't have a beef with each other but ultimately they fight each other - well, we're in a MK movie right? No. In my humble opinion it could have been a really fascinating and multi layered story and ride into cultures, lore and characters but ended where the majority of CGI loaded movies end... Sure some settings are nice but again, not new or jaw dropping. Some fights are well choreographed but they don't blow u out of the water. Overall I was very disappointed and felt it's a lost opportunity to tell something new and innovative.",Warning: Spoilers

Permalink",13,17,3,"This movie was more concerned with setting up a franchise than telling an entertaining story. The violence was great when it was there, but for long stretches I was bored. BORED! In a Mortal Kombat movie! How do you mess up a movie about a martial arts tournament with supernatural powers. They didn't even have a tournament! LONG stretches of people talking about finding their powers. BORING. And I'm down for a high brow serious reboot if it works. This did not work, they didn't even try to make it work. It was obviously written as a pg13 teen movie, and made the decision to make it R afterwards. Rather than making the plot mode adult they added blood. It's awful.Seriously, rent the original. This is a waste. A waste of money, time and an opportunity to reboot this franchise.",

Permalink",6,6,3,"Cole's plot armor was cheesier than the entire original 1995 movie.Why did Sub-Zero and Scorpion's outfits make them look so fat with all of the padding?Goro looked like he belonged in World Warcraft and was completely wasted.Kano was funny. Sub-Zero was basically Michael Myers .. so that was neat. Fatalities looked great.Liu Kang and Shang Tsung are forgettable compared to the OG film. Couldn't hear a thing Raiden said.Good fx, choreography was fine, and nice of them to show some lesser known characters. Kabal & Kung Lao were top notch.Cole is completely unnecessary with the huge amount of MK characters that there already are. He cheapened the final fight.Akana is also random and a new element that I can live with.. but why?The 1995 film did way better capturing the essence of what Mortal Kombat was, came out at the right time, and had a way bigger impact. Mortal Kombat 2021 was just ok.. and that's sadly it.With that being said.. I hope they improve upon what they have in the sequel. Looking forward to seeing it and please kill Cole's character within the first scene or forget about him.",Warning: Spoilers

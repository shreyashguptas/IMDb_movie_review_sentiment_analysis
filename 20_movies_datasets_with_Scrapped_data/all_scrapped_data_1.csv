2 losers Ishaan Khattar ( Gullu) & Sidhant Chaturvedi( Major) team up with a friendly Bhatakti Aatma ( Ragini) Katrina as the Desi Ghostbusters. However the Ragini has an agenda of her own. There is also an evil tantric ( Aatmaram) Jackie Shroff who is jealous of their success & trying to get rid of them with his army of ghosts. Will our bungling duo outwit the villains and be victorious in the end is what this film is all about.Kudos to the makers for attempting something different. The camaraderie between the protagonists is decent, though they are a bit loud at times.However there aren't many lol moments in the film which is a travesty when u r attempting a film in the horror-comedy genre. Jackie as tantric Aatmaram is funny with his ""bhidu"" type one-liners. Ending is quite predictable which again lets you down.What I liked are the references to old horror films like the Ramsey's and some well executed slapstick comedy scenes which invoke spontaneous laughter. Unfortunately there aren't many of these!!A good attempt by makers to try something new. Not as bad as Roohi, yet ...not as good as Stree!!Will give it a 2.5/5 ...

Permalink",9,12,8.0,"Movies like Phone Bhoot are rare from Bollywood. With a multicultural region of India, focussing on a script like this is tough. I feel, Gurmmeet Singh handled it really good. The cast is amazing. Ishaan and Siddhant should be applauded for their comedy roles.The plot is quite simple and the ending a little anti-climactic. But that doesn't take away from the fun ride that is this movie. It's a horror comedy cum buddy comedy. And these are rare. I have seen this movie being compared to multiple other movies especially, Ghostbusters. And of course that can be drawn. It's because this movie spoofs the others. The music was fun too. Love the songs. Especially, Nidhi, Ishan, and Siddhant dancing to Kali Teri. With pop culture references being made really good, I enjoyed this movie throughout.Of course this could have been better. The movie does lose the plot a bit towards the end. The end was quite anti-climactic. And the sequel pull could have been set a lil better. Some jokes didn't land the right way.Having said that, I watched this movie thrice. Once at the theatres and twice after renting it on Prime Video. And I enjoyed it every time.

Permalink",3,5,7.0,"Phone bhoot is a comedy horror film directed by gurmmeet singh.Ishan khattar and siddhant chaturvedi did a fine job with their over the top performances. Sometimes unnecessary, but just does fine. Katrina kaif, surprisingly, brings a seriousness into the film. Her hindi too, way better than the previous films. Jackie shroff has played much better and evil characters than this, so he was decent. The other characters were a hit and a miss.The characters, at first, seem to be quite interesting but as the film goes on, they feel lethargic and dull. Their jokes don't land properly, the writing is bad in some places, which just makes the sequences all over the place. This doesn't mean that the jokes are awful. The meme references here are excellent. Mirzapur's theme music, the coffin dance, bohot hard everything is paid a tribute here. The bengali trope of pronunciation of moksh is hilarious. Various films get a mention here, ghostbusters is an obvious one but ramsay brothers' films and their character raaks play an important role. This film is a pandora box of reference notes, check those out for sure, its entertaining. The montage scenes being told out loud was funny.The cinematography is brilliant. The various camera angles used bring a sense of trippyness in the film. Its nonsensical and wacky, and it has been handled pretty well. The colour grading in some sequences is damn good.Its negative is its only a comedy film and not a horror one. There is not one scene where you feel the fear.The vfx and special effects is very good in some scenes and also tacky in other scenes.Its a decent fim in my opinion, not as bad as some bollywood haters tell you.

Permalink",4,9,4.0,"Phone Bhoot (2022) :
Movie Review -Katrina Kaif stars as a sexy bhoot, and Ishaan Khatter and Siddhant Chaturvedi star as bhoot catchers in the Gurmmeet Singh extra-large comedy, ""Phone Bhoot."" The horror comedy genre was uplifted by Amar Kaushik's ""Stree"" (2018), and since then everyone is dying to make a film like that. Some have actually died as filmmakers during the process. Be it Roohi, Bhoot Police, or the recent blockbuster Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, none of the films could match even half of Stree. It's a fact and very fair to say that just because Amar made Stree, we have started expecting every horror comedy to be that good, which is not practically possible and didn't happen in the past either. James Whale's landmark horror comedy, ""The Old Dark House"" (1932), or Abbott & Costello's comedies with horror legends like Frankenstein, the Werewolf, and Dracula have been memorable and unbeaten for decades, so we can't expect this modern generation of filmmakers, who are influenced by their past projects, to tap into that. Phone Bhoot is one such attempt, in which Gurmmeet has tried to be extra funny with an overuse of spoofs, and at the same time he wanted to take care of children's-oriented comedy too. That's a mess, or rather, that's the only thing that causes mega destruction to this wannabe healthy ghost comedy.Phone Bhoot starts off with two friends, Gullu (Ishaan Khatter) and Major (Siddhant Chaturvedi), trying to be famous Ghostbusters. Their attempts flop continuously, but then one day, a sexy ghost called Ragini (Katrina Kaif) comes up with a business idea. Reluctant to accept the offer in the first meeting, Gullu and Major are forced to team up with her for their own good. The Phone Bhoot Gang emerges as a saviour for many and becomes famous, only to generate a deadly enemy, Atmaram (Jackie Shroff). Will Gullu and Major be able to help Ragini, and defeat the powerful Atmaram? Phone Bhoot will answer your calls.On the positive side, Phone Bhoot is actually funny on many occasions. The film has subtle humour reflecting intellectual jokes that are hard to catch or sometimes appear late in your mind. The only problem is that it tries to be the same in every single minute of the film, be it an emotional scene, a conflict, action, or even a song. You can't be so repetitive with your most loved part because then it becomes cliche. Out of 100 lines, a film can have 40 or at most 50 lines, and the rest of the parts are left to connect the audience with characters, an introduction, drama, romance, or whatever the genre is. Even in the thriller genre, you can't be suspenseful all the time because you are making a feature film and not a short. That's the basic rule. Gurmmeet Singh's horror comedy keeps it away from his ghost universe, hence causing its own destruction. The screenplay is tight, though. It may be repetitive and annoying on a few occasions, but never boring.When it comes to performances, Ishaan and Siddhant seem to have a ball. Ishaan was never so funny, even in his media interviews (that's the funniest version of his I've ever experienced). He has quite a peculiar character to play here, and despite many flaws in the writing, he has done a good job. Siddhant is still waiting for the kind of magic he spread in ""Gully Boy"" (2019), but with Phone Bhoot, he seems to have gotten a break for himself. Major is not a regular funny character, man; it's one level up from that definition you have in mind. The sexy looks of Katrina Kaif will definitely kill you, if not her bhootiyagiri. Jackie Shroff just comes and behaves like what he is - a bindass bhidu. I am not sure if Sheeba Chaddha has ever looked so annoying in a film, and the supporting cast is not that good either.Phone Bhoot has a decent music album, but the video songs are smartly choreographed. Ganesh Hegde has taken us back to Govinda's ""Money Hai Toh Honey Hai"" dance form with ""Kinna Sona."" The earlier portion of ""Kaali Teri Gutt"" is so good. Especially Ishaant has gone crazy there, and it's somewhat funny too. The cinematography, editing, and VFX fare at a below-par level. Gurmeet has studied a lot about horror legends, maybe. He mixes all the pop culture references, old horror comics, modern thoughts, social media and WhatsApp jokes, and even the technology into making one film. That's quite confusing, for him and for the audiences as well. I saw the entire film but still couldn't make out if the ""RAKA"" was a sculpture/idol of Boris Karloff from Frankenstein or Anirudh Agarwal from ""Bandh Darwaja"" (1990). Gurmmeet goes over the top with everything in the film, causing an alternate fall to his own building. As a whole, Phone Bhoot builds a decent structure out of multiple designs but forgets the basic engineering rules. Who knows; it was made for ghosts, not the audience.RATING - 4/10*",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,6,3.0,"This movie (if you can call it that) is an incoherent mess of unfunny scenes. I kid you not, the funniest scene in this borefest is the cameo of the guys from fukrey movie franchise.This movie is only a poor attempt at comedy, and does not have an iota of fear-inducing horror. I doubt that even a 5 year old child would be scared by the few jump scares in this movie.There is barely a story, which only gets like 15-20 minutes of the actual runtime. The script is almost non-existent. Looks like instead of a script, somebody just lazily jotted out notes for possible scenes in the name of script, and then asked the actors to perform them as they saw fit.The acting is atrocious, and Katrina Kaif is the worst offender. To her credit, it is not for lack of trying. Jackie Shroff's character is more a caricature than a villainous character. Only Siddhant and Ishaan showed better acting chops, though that's not much to say, given how low the bar was for acting in this movie.Looking at the imdb rating (5.9 at the time of writing), I thought to give it a try on OTT, but I honestly want my time back. It's not worth a watch even on OTT. I'd recommend you to watch any of the classific indian horror comedies (e.g. Bhool Bhulaiya, Stree) rather than wasting time over this.I thought Bhoot Police (featuring Saif, Arjun, Yami Gautam and Jacqueline) was bad, but compared to Phone Bhoot, it now looks like a masterpiece. Sure, Bhoot Police had bad acting, cheesy dialogues, mindless story, but at least it had acting, dialogues and story. By comparison, Phone Bhoot is a directionless, storyless, acting-less, inconsistent piece of hot mess.",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

2 losers Ishaan Khattar ( Gullu) & Sidhant Chaturvedi( Major) team up with a friendly Bhatakti Aatma ( Ragini) Katrina as the Desi Ghostbusters. However the Ragini has an agenda of her own. There is also an evil tantric ( Aatmaram) Jackie Shroff who is jealous of their success & trying to get rid of them with his army of ghosts. Will our bungling duo outwit the villains and be victorious in the end is what this film is all about.Kudos to the makers for attempting something different. The camaraderie between the protagonists is decent, though they are a bit loud at times.However there aren't many lol moments in the film which is a travesty when u r attempting a film in the horror-comedy genre. Jackie as tantric Aatmaram is funny with his ""bhidu"" type one-liners. Ending is quite predictable which again lets you down.What I liked are the references to old horror films like the Ramsey's and some well executed slapstick comedy scenes which invoke spontaneous laughter. Unfortunately there aren't many of these!!A good attempt by makers to try something new. Not as bad as Roohi, yet ...not as good as Stree!!Will give it a 2.5/5 ...

Jackie shroff has played much better and evil characters than this, so he was decent. The other characters were a hit and a miss.The characters, at first, seem to be quite interesting but as the film goes on, they feel lethargic and dull. Their jokes don't land properly, the writing is bad in some places, which just makes the sequences all over the place. This doesn't mean that the jokes are awful. The meme references here are excellent. Mirzapur's theme music, the coffin dance, bohot hard everything is paid a tribute here. The bengali trope of pronunciation of moksh is hilarious. Various films get a mention here, ghostbusters is an obvious one but ramsay brothers' films and their character raaks play an important role. This film is a pandora box of reference notes, check those out for sure, its entertaining. The montage scenes being told out loud was funny.The cinematography is brilliant. The various camera angles used bring a sense of trippyness in the film. Its nonsensical and wacky, and it has been handled pretty well. The colour grading in some sequences is damn good.Its negative is its only a comedy film and not a horror one. There is not one scene where you feel the fear.The vfx and special effects is very good in some scenes and also tacky in other scenes.Its a decent fim in my opinion, not as bad as some bollywood haters tell you.

Permalink",4,9,4.0,"Phone Bhoot (2022) :
Movie Review -Katrina Kaif stars as a sexy bhoot, and Ishaan Khatter and Siddhant Chaturvedi star as bhoot catchers in the Gurmmeet Singh extra-large comedy, ""Phone Bhoot."" The horror comedy genre was uplifted by Amar Kaushik's ""Stree"" (2018), and since then everyone is dying to make a film like that. Some have actually died as filmmakers during the process. Be it Roohi, Bhoot Police, or the recent blockbuster Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, none of the films could match even half of Stree. It's a fact and very fair to say that just because Amar made Stree, we have started expecting every horror comedy to be that good, which is not practically possible and didn't happen in the past either. James Whale's landmark horror comedy, ""The Old Dark House"" (1932), or Abbott & Costello's comedies with horror legends like Frankenstein, the Werewolf, and Dracula have been memorable and unbeaten for decades, so we can't expect this modern generation of filmmakers, who are influenced by their past projects, to tap into that. Phone Bhoot is one such attempt, in which Gurmmeet has tried to be extra funny with an overuse of spoofs, and at the same time he wanted to take care of children's-oriented comedy too. That's a mess, or rather, that's the only thing that causes mega destruction to this wannabe healthy ghost comedy.Phone Bhoot starts off with two friends, Gullu (Ishaan Khatter) and Major (Siddhant Chaturvedi), trying to be famous Ghostbusters. Their attempts flop continuously, but then one day, a sexy ghost called Ragini (Katrina Kaif) comes up with a business idea. Reluctant to accept the offer in the first meeting, Gullu and Major are forced to team up with her for their own good. The Phone Bhoot Gang emerges as a saviour for many and becomes famous, only to generate a deadly enemy, Atmaram (Jackie Shroff). Will Gullu and Major be able to help Ragini, and defeat the powerful Atmaram? Phone Bhoot will answer your calls.On the positive side, Phone Bhoot is actually funny on many occasions. The film has subtle humour reflecting intellectual jokes that are hard to catch or sometimes appear late in your mind. The only problem is that it tries to be the same in every single minute of the film, be it an emotional scene, a conflict, action, or even a song. You can't be so repetitive with your most loved part because then it becomes cliche. Out of 100 lines, a film can have 40 or at most 50 lines, and the rest of the parts are left to connect the audience with characters, an introduction, drama, romance, or whatever the genre is. Even in the thriller genre, you can't be suspenseful all the time because you are making a feature film and not a short. That's the basic rule. Gurmmeet Singh's horror comedy keeps it away from his ghost universe, hence causing its own destruction. The screenplay is tight, though. It may be repetitive and annoying on a few occasions, but never boring.When it comes to performances, Ishaan and Siddhant seem to have a ball. Ishaan was never so funny, even in his media interviews (that's the funniest version of his I've ever experienced). He has quite a peculiar character to play here, and despite many flaws in the writing, he has done a good job. Siddhant is still waiting for the kind of magic he spread in ""Gully Boy"" (2019), but with Phone Bhoot, he seems to have gotten a break for himself. Major is not a regular funny character, man; it's one level up from that definition you have in mind. The sexy looks of Katrina Kaif will definitely kill you, if not her bhootiyagiri. Jackie Shroff just comes and behaves like what he is - a bindass bhidu. I am not sure if Sheeba Chaddha has ever looked so annoying in a film, and the supporting cast is not that good either.Phone Bhoot has a decent music album, but the video songs are smartly choreographed. Ganesh Hegde has taken us back to Govinda's ""Money Hai Toh Honey Hai"" dance form with ""Kinna Sona."" The earlier portion of ""Kaali Teri Gutt"" is so good. Especially Ishaant has gone crazy there, and it's somewhat funny too. The cinematography, editing, and VFX fare at a below-par level. Gurmeet has studied a lot about horror legends, maybe. He mixes all the pop culture references, old horror comics, modern thoughts, social media and WhatsApp jokes, and even the technology into making one film. That's quite confusing, for him and for the audiences as well. I saw the entire film but still couldn't make out if the ""RAKA"" was a sculpture/idol of Boris Karloff from Frankenstein or Anirudh Agarwal from ""Bandh Darwaja"" (1990). Gurmmeet goes over the top with everything in the film, causing an alternate fall to his own building. As a whole, Phone Bhoot builds a decent structure out of multiple designs but forgets the basic engineering rules. Who knows; it was made for ghosts, not the audience.RATING - 4/10*",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,6,3.0,"This movie (if you can call it that) is an incoherent mess of unfunny scenes. I kid you not, the funniest scene in this borefest is the cameo of the guys from fukrey movie franchise.This movie is only a poor attempt at comedy, and does not have an iota of fear-inducing horror. I doubt that even a 5 year old child would be scared by the few jump scares in this movie.There is barely a story, which only gets like 15-20 minutes of the actual runtime. The script is almost non-existent. Looks like instead of a script, somebody just lazily jotted out notes for possible scenes in the name of script, and then asked the actors to perform them as they saw fit.The acting is atrocious, and Katrina Kaif is the worst offender. To her credit, it is not for lack of trying. Jackie Shroff's character is more a caricature than a villainous character. Only Siddhant and Ishaan showed better acting chops, though that's not much to say, given how low the bar was for acting in this movie.Looking at the imdb rating (5.9 at the time of writing), I thought to give it a try on OTT, but I honestly want my time back. It's not worth a watch even on OTT. I'd recommend you to watch any of the classific indian horror comedies (e.g. Bhool Bhulaiya, Stree) rather than wasting time over this.I thought Bhoot Police (featuring Saif, Arjun, Yami Gautam and Jacqueline) was bad, but compared to Phone Bhoot, it now looks like a masterpiece. Sure, Bhoot Police had bad acting, cheesy dialogues, mindless story, but at least it had acting, dialogues and story.

Permalink",0,0,6.0,"I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting a whole lot from this 2022 Indian horror comedy, as I sat down to watch it here in 2023. I had never heard about the movie, but I still opted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt and give it a fair chance.Turns out that writers Jasvinder Bath and Ravi Shankaran actually put together an enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline here. I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 136 minutes that the movie ran for. There were some good laughs along the way, given some hilarious situations and dialogue. Personally, I can't say that I understand why Bollywood movies cram in the obligatory dance and song routines in the middle of a narrative, and it was also present in ""Phone Bhoot"".Needless to say that, given my limited exposure to Indian cinema, then I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie. But I liked the performances I saw on the screen, and they had some good leading performers with Katrina Kaif (playing Ragini), Ishaan Khattar (playing Gullu) and Siddhant Chaturvedi (playing Major).Visually then I found ""Phone Bhoot"" to be better than I had expected and anticipated it to be. The special effects in the movie were actually fairly good. And they definitely helped to add to the overall enjoyment of the movie.The movie could have benefitted a bit from a more roundhanded trim in the editing room, because 136 minutes was a bit too long, as there were some slow patches throughout the course of the movie.My rating of director Gurmmeet Singh's 2022 horror comedy ""Phone Bhoot"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",0,0,7.0,"Phone Bhoot is a long reel of spot-the-pop-culture-reference trying to be a coherent movie. The Hindi film buff in me was thrilled at some of them. I almost hooted when Raka from Ramsay Brothers, Purana Mandir (1984) appeared to make a longish cameo. The writers have added a fair dose of pop culture references. From Katrina's Slice ads to K3G homages and Jackie Shroff playing the Hero tune on a flute, Phone Bhoot dabbles in everything, and successfully most of the times. The climax is a bit of a letdown when the villain built as this all-powerful evil is defeated in a rather silly manner. The shaky camera fights do no favour to the sequence either.Katrina is the film's star and her screen presence is solid. It is a delight to see her enjoy herself so wholeheartedly on screen. Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter nail the wicked mood as the charming Punjabi and Tamil ghostbusters. Jackie Shroff also surrenders to the absurdist mood, as he plays the iconic Hero tune in the garb of a villain.A fun watch despite all the grievances.",Warning: Spoilers,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",5,14,7.0,"I barely had any expectations from this film, specially since the trailer was below average and the songs weren't great either. However, after seeing people mostly praising the film, I decided to step into the theatres and I was not disappointed.The film sets the tone from the disclaimer itself, it's wacky, it's stupid, it's absurd, but most importantly, it's FUN.Phone Bhoot consists of a lot of pop culture references, be it the tone of the narrator or the countless puns and references present throughout the film which usually hit the mark. Yes, there are a few forced gags which fail to generate any laughter but you will find yourself enjoying the film nevertheless.Talking about performances, it's about the guys. Ishan and Siddhant absolutely nail their respective roles, their chemistry just makes up for so many memorable moments and the two seem to have pretty good comic timing as well. Katrina does justice to her role, she isn't anything spectacular but is just about good enough. Jackie Shroff in his bhidu mode is whistle worthy, though I would've liked to see more of him. The supporting cast also do justice to their roles.The only issue with the film is the unsatisfactory climax. What could've been a humorous and chaotic ending ends up being a cgi mesh that's just all over the place.

It's a gripping, surprising, and realistic psychological saga. Even more captivating is the music in the background.

2 losers Ishaan Khattar ( Gullu) & Sidhant Chaturvedi( Major) team up with a friendly Bhatakti Aatma ( Ragini) Katrina as the Desi Ghostbusters. However the Ragini has an agenda of her own. There is also an evil tantric ( Aatmaram) Jackie Shroff who is jealous of their success & trying to get rid of them with his army of ghosts. Will our bungling duo outwit the villains and be victorious in the end is what this film is all about.Kudos to the makers for attempting something different. The camaraderie between the protagonists is decent, though they are a bit loud at times.However there aren't many lol moments in the film which is a travesty when u r attempting a film in the horror-comedy genre. Jackie as tantric Aatmaram is funny with his ""bhidu"" type one-liners. Ending is quite predictable which again lets you down.What I liked are the references to old horror films like the Ramsey's and some well executed slapstick comedy scenes which invoke spontaneous laughter. Unfortunately there aren't many of these!!A good attempt by makers to try something new. Not as bad as Roohi, yet ...not as good as Stree!!Will give it a 2.5/5 ...

Various films get a mention here, ghostbusters is an obvious one but ramsay brothers' films and their character raaks play an important role. This film is a pandora box of reference notes, check those out for sure, its entertaining. The montage scenes being told out loud was funny.The cinematography is brilliant. The various camera angles used bring a sense of trippyness in the film. Its nonsensical and wacky, and it has been handled pretty well. The colour grading in some sequences is damn good.Its negative is its only a comedy film and not a horror one.

Permalink",4,9,4.0,"Phone Bhoot (2022) :
Movie Review -Katrina Kaif stars as a sexy bhoot, and Ishaan Khatter and Siddhant Chaturvedi star as bhoot catchers in the Gurmmeet Singh extra-large comedy, ""Phone Bhoot."" The horror comedy genre was uplifted by Amar Kaushik's ""Stree"" (2018), and since then everyone is dying to make a film like that. Some have actually died as filmmakers during the process. Be it Roohi, Bhoot Police, or the recent blockbuster Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, none of the films could match even half of Stree. It's a fact and very fair to say that just because Amar made Stree, we have started expecting every horror comedy to be that good, which is not practically possible and didn't happen in the past either. James Whale's landmark horror comedy, ""The Old Dark House"" (1932), or Abbott & Costello's comedies with horror legends like Frankenstein, the Werewolf, and Dracula have been memorable and unbeaten for decades, so we can't expect this modern generation of filmmakers, who are influenced by their past projects, to tap into that. Phone Bhoot is one such attempt, in which Gurmmeet has tried to be extra funny with an overuse of spoofs, and at the same time he wanted to take care of children's-oriented comedy too. That's a mess, or rather, that's the only thing that causes mega destruction to this wannabe healthy ghost comedy.Phone Bhoot starts off with two friends, Gullu (Ishaan Khatter) and Major (Siddhant Chaturvedi), trying to be famous Ghostbusters. Their attempts flop continuously, but then one day, a sexy ghost called Ragini (Katrina Kaif) comes up with a business idea. Reluctant to accept the offer in the first meeting, Gullu and Major are forced to team up with her for their own good. The Phone Bhoot Gang emerges as a saviour for many and becomes famous, only to generate a deadly enemy, Atmaram (Jackie Shroff). Will Gullu and Major be able to help Ragini, and defeat the powerful Atmaram? Phone Bhoot will answer your calls.On the positive side, Phone Bhoot is actually funny on many occasions. The film has subtle humour reflecting intellectual jokes that are hard to catch or sometimes appear late in your mind. The only problem is that it tries to be the same in every single minute of the film, be it an emotional scene, a conflict, action, or even a song. You can't be so repetitive with your most loved part because then it becomes cliche. Out of 100 lines, a film can have 40 or at most 50 lines, and the rest of the parts are left to connect the audience with characters, an introduction, drama, romance, or whatever the genre is. Even in the thriller genre, you can't be suspenseful all the time because you are making a feature film and not a short. That's the basic rule. Gurmmeet Singh's horror comedy keeps it away from his ghost universe, hence causing its own destruction. The screenplay is tight, though. It may be repetitive and annoying on a few occasions, but never boring.When it comes to performances, Ishaan and Siddhant seem to have a ball. Ishaan was never so funny, even in his media interviews (that's the funniest version of his I've ever experienced). He has quite a peculiar character to play here, and despite many flaws in the writing, he has done a good job. Siddhant is still waiting for the kind of magic he spread in ""Gully Boy"" (2019), but with Phone Bhoot, he seems to have gotten a break for himself. Major is not a regular funny character, man; it's one level up from that definition you have in mind. The sexy looks of Katrina Kaif will definitely kill you, if not her bhootiyagiri. Jackie Shroff just comes and behaves like what he is - a bindass bhidu. I am not sure if Sheeba Chaddha has ever looked so annoying in a film, and the supporting cast is not that good either.Phone Bhoot has a decent music album, but the video songs are smartly choreographed. Ganesh Hegde has taken us back to Govinda's ""Money Hai Toh Honey Hai"" dance form with ""Kinna Sona."" The earlier portion of ""Kaali Teri Gutt"" is so good. Especially Ishaant has gone crazy there, and it's somewhat funny too. The cinematography, editing, and VFX fare at a below-par level. Gurmeet has studied a lot about horror legends, maybe. He mixes all the pop culture references, old horror comics, modern thoughts, social media and WhatsApp jokes, and even the technology into making one film. That's quite confusing, for him and for the audiences as well. I saw the entire film but still couldn't make out if the ""RAKA"" was a sculpture/idol of Boris Karloff from Frankenstein or Anirudh Agarwal from ""Bandh Darwaja"" (1990). Gurmmeet goes over the top with everything in the film, causing an alternate fall to his own building. As a whole, Phone Bhoot builds a decent structure out of multiple designs but forgets the basic engineering rules. Who knows; it was made for ghosts, not the audience.RATING - 4/10*",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,6,3.0,"This movie (if you can call it that) is an incoherent mess of unfunny scenes. I kid you not, the funniest scene in this borefest is the cameo of the guys from fukrey movie franchise.This movie is only a poor attempt at comedy, and does not have an iota of fear-inducing horror. I doubt that even a 5 year old child would be scared by the few jump scares in this movie.There is barely a story, which only gets like 15-20 minutes of the actual runtime. The script is almost non-existent. Looks like instead of a script, somebody just lazily jotted out notes for possible scenes in the name of script, and then asked the actors to perform them as they saw fit.The acting is atrocious, and Katrina Kaif is the worst offender. To her credit, it is not for lack of trying. Jackie Shroff's character is more a caricature than a villainous character. Only Siddhant and Ishaan showed better acting chops, though that's not much to say, given how low the bar was for acting in this movie.Looking at the imdb rating (5.9 at the time of writing), I thought to give it a try on OTT, but I honestly want my time back. It's not worth a watch even on OTT. I'd recommend you to watch any of the classific indian horror comedies (e.g. Bhool Bhulaiya, Stree) rather than wasting time over this.I thought Bhoot Police (featuring Saif, Arjun, Yami Gautam and Jacqueline) was bad, but compared to Phone Bhoot, it now looks like a masterpiece. Sure, Bhoot Police had bad acting, cheesy dialogues, mindless story, but at least it had acting, dialogues and story.

Permalink",0,0,6.0,"I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting a whole lot from this 2022 Indian horror comedy, as I sat down to watch it here in 2023. I had never heard about the movie, but I still opted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt and give it a fair chance.Turns out that writers Jasvinder Bath and Ravi Shankaran actually put together an enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline here. I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 136 minutes that the movie ran for. There were some good laughs along the way, given some hilarious situations and dialogue. Personally, I can't say that I understand why Bollywood movies cram in the obligatory dance and song routines in the middle of a narrative, and it was also present in ""Phone Bhoot"".Needless to say that, given my limited exposure to Indian cinema, then I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie. But I liked the performances I saw on the screen, and they had some good leading performers with Katrina Kaif (playing Ragini), Ishaan Khattar (playing Gullu) and Siddhant Chaturvedi (playing Major).Visually then I found ""Phone Bhoot"" to be better than I had expected and anticipated it to be. The special effects in the movie were actually fairly good. And they definitely helped to add to the overall enjoyment of the movie.The movie could have benefitted a bit from a more roundhanded trim in the editing room, because 136 minutes was a bit too long, as there were some slow patches throughout the course of the movie.My rating of director Gurmmeet Singh's 2022 horror comedy ""Phone Bhoot"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",1,8,10.0,"Nice movie I recently watched this psychological suspense film; it is a rollercoaster of unexpected twists and turns. It's not an easy watch; it's a dark, tense, well-written thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It will undoubtedly make you shiver. Even though it can be challenging to sit through a movie of this length in this genre, Raj Tewari has done an exceptional job, and you'll find yourself completely absorbed in the story after only a few minutes. It's a gripping, surprising, and realistic psychological saga. Even more captivating is the music in the background. I'm still perplexed as to why this movie didn't even receive a nod for a national award. I saw it tense thriller after a long time. The original language version.

The combinations of background items and other things/situations during the scene require the presence of mind.Making a comedy movie, a horror movie, or a horror comedy is something which can be achieved by experience. But creating scenes with such a silent yet creativity is a whole different thing and cannot be achieved by every other person.Movies like this really amaze me. Reason - Almost entire bollywood is filled with drugists who no longer have brains to think at this level. Rest of them are busy in creating anti national propaganda scripts.This is a must watch movie if you are a horror comedy fan and appreciate unique cinematography. Although I rated this movie as 7 star, but this is because the story does not have that much of strength. But still it is a nice movie.",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

2 losers Ishaan Khattar ( Gullu) & Sidhant Chaturvedi( Major) team up with a friendly Bhatakti Aatma ( Ragini) Katrina as the Desi Ghostbusters. However the Ragini has an agenda of her own. There is also an evil tantric ( Aatmaram) Jackie Shroff who is jealous of their success & trying to get rid of them with his army of ghosts. Will our bungling duo outwit the villains and be victorious in the end is what this film is all about.Kudos to the makers for attempting something different. The camaraderie between the protagonists is decent, though they are a bit loud at times.However there aren't many lol moments in the film which is a travesty when u r attempting a film in the horror-comedy genre. Jackie as tantric Aatmaram is funny with his ""bhidu"" type one-liners. Ending is quite predictable which again lets you down.What I liked are the references to old horror films like the Ramsey's and some well executed slapstick comedy scenes which invoke spontaneous laughter. Unfortunately there aren't many of these!!A good attempt by makers to try something new. Not as bad as Roohi, yet ...not as good as Stree!!Will give it a 2.5/5 ...

Permalink",7,10,5.0,The subject of ghost busters is good and different and even better when dealt as a horror comedy instead of serious or drama but subject is not delivered well and the characters instead of comic looked idiots. Even story is weak. The comic timings of Jackie Shroff and Katrina Kaif is not worth it. Actually I am thinking what's Jackie Shroff is doing in the film. When we have horror comedies like Bhoot Police and Stree dealing with subject so nicely in comparison this film looks totally useless. Have some moments but those are not enough to uplift the movie to make it more like-able.

Because I had a much higher ceiling of expectations for the film, I would like to exclusively attribute the fault to those who orchestrated the marketing strategies in advance of its release.

It was not the uproarious, outrageous parody I was hoping it would come to be. Albeit thanks to its star-studded ensemble which kept me fairly occupied.

Permalink",9,12,8.0,"Movies like Phone Bhoot are rare from Bollywood. With a multicultural region of India, focussing on a script like this is tough. I feel, Gurmmeet Singh handled it really good. The cast is amazing. Ishaan and Siddhant should be applauded for their comedy roles.The plot is quite simple and the ending a little anti-climactic. But that doesn't take away from the fun ride that is this movie. It's a horror comedy cum buddy comedy. And these are rare. I have seen this movie being compared to multiple other movies especially, Ghostbusters. And of course that can be drawn. It's because this movie spoofs the others. The music was fun too. Love the songs. Especially, Nidhi, Ishan, and Siddhant dancing to Kali Teri. With pop culture references being made really good, I enjoyed this movie throughout.Of course this could have been better. The movie does lose the plot a bit towards the end. The end was quite anti-climactic. And the sequel pull could have been set a lil better. Some jokes didn't land the right way.Having said that, I watched this movie thrice. Once at the theatres and twice after renting it on Prime Video. And I enjoyed it every time. Please ignore the low ratings and baseless negative review and enjoy the movie, currently available on Prime Video for rent. Or wait till it's available in the catalogue.

Permalink",3,5,7.0,"Phone bhoot is a comedy horror film directed by gurmmeet singh.Ishan khattar and siddhant chaturvedi did a fine job with their over the top performances. Sometimes unnecessary, but just does fine. Katrina kaif, surprisingly, brings a seriousness into the film. Her hindi too, way better than the previous films. Jackie shroff has played much better and evil characters than this, so he was decent. The other characters were a hit and a miss.The characters, at first, seem to be quite interesting but as the film goes on, they feel lethargic and dull. Their jokes don't land properly, the writing is bad in some places, which just makes the sequences all over the place. This doesn't mean that the jokes are awful. The meme references here are excellent. Mirzapur's theme music, the coffin dance, bohot hard everything is paid a tribute here. The bengali trope of pronunciation of moksh is hilarious. Various films get a mention here, ghostbusters is an obvious one but ramsay brothers' films and their character raaks play an important role. This film is a pandora box of reference notes, check those out for sure, its entertaining. The montage scenes being told out loud was funny.The cinematography is brilliant. The various camera angles used bring a sense of trippyness in the film. Its nonsensical and wacky, and it has been handled pretty well. The colour grading in some sequences is damn good.Its negative is its only a comedy film and not a horror one. There is not one scene where you feel the fear.The vfx and special effects is very good in some scenes and also tacky in other scenes.Its a decent fim in my opinion, not as bad as some bollywood haters tell you.

Permalink",4,9,4.0,"Phone Bhoot (2022) :
Movie Review -Katrina Kaif stars as a sexy bhoot, and Ishaan Khatter and Siddhant Chaturvedi star as bhoot catchers in the Gurmmeet Singh extra-large comedy, ""Phone Bhoot."" The horror comedy genre was uplifted by Amar Kaushik's ""Stree"" (2018), and since then everyone is dying to make a film like that. Some have actually died as filmmakers during the process. Be it Roohi, Bhoot Police, or the recent blockbuster Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, none of the films could match even half of Stree. It's a fact and very fair to say that just because Amar made Stree, we have started expecting every horror comedy to be that good, which is not practically possible and didn't happen in the past either. James Whale's landmark horror comedy, ""The Old Dark House"" (1932), or Abbott & Costello's comedies with horror legends like Frankenstein, the Werewolf, and Dracula have been memorable and unbeaten for decades, so we can't expect this modern generation of filmmakers, who are influenced by their past projects, to tap into that. Phone Bhoot is one such attempt, in which Gurmmeet has tried to be extra funny with an overuse of spoofs, and at the same time he wanted to take care of children's-oriented comedy too. That's a mess, or rather, that's the only thing that causes mega destruction to this wannabe healthy ghost comedy.Phone Bhoot starts off with two friends, Gullu (Ishaan Khatter) and Major (Siddhant Chaturvedi), trying to be famous Ghostbusters. Their attempts flop continuously, but then one day, a sexy ghost called Ragini (Katrina Kaif) comes up with a business idea. Reluctant to accept the offer in the first meeting, Gullu and Major are forced to team up with her for their own good. The Phone Bhoot Gang emerges as a saviour for many and becomes famous, only to generate a deadly enemy, Atmaram (Jackie Shroff). Will Gullu and Major be able to help Ragini, and defeat the powerful Atmaram? Phone Bhoot will answer your calls.On the positive side, Phone Bhoot is actually funny on many occasions. The film has subtle humour reflecting intellectual jokes that are hard to catch or sometimes appear late in your mind. The only problem is that it tries to be the same in every single minute of the film, be it an emotional scene, a conflict, action, or even a song. You can't be so repetitive with your most loved part because then it becomes cliche. Out of 100 lines, a film can have 40 or at most 50 lines, and the rest of the parts are left to connect the audience with characters, an introduction, drama, romance, or whatever the genre is. Even in the thriller genre, you can't be suspenseful all the time because you are making a feature film and not a short. That's the basic rule. Gurmmeet Singh's horror comedy keeps it away from his ghost universe, hence causing its own destruction. The screenplay is tight, though. It may be repetitive and annoying on a few occasions, but never boring.When it comes to performances, Ishaan and Siddhant seem to have a ball. Ishaan was never so funny, even in his media interviews (that's the funniest version of his I've ever experienced). He has quite a peculiar character to play here, and despite many flaws in the writing, he has done a good job. Siddhant is still waiting for the kind of magic he spread in ""Gully Boy"" (2019), but with Phone Bhoot, he seems to have gotten a break for himself. Major is not a regular funny character, man; it's one level up from that definition you have in mind. The sexy looks of Katrina Kaif will definitely kill you, if not her bhootiyagiri. Jackie Shroff just comes and behaves like what he is - a bindass bhidu. I am not sure if Sheeba Chaddha has ever looked so annoying in a film, and the supporting cast is not that good either.Phone Bhoot has a decent music album, but the video songs are smartly choreographed. Ganesh Hegde has taken us back to Govinda's ""Money Hai Toh Honey Hai"" dance form with ""Kinna Sona."" The earlier portion of ""Kaali Teri Gutt"" is so good. Especially Ishaant has gone crazy there, and it's somewhat funny too. The cinematography, editing, and VFX fare at a below-par level. Gurmeet has studied a lot about horror legends, maybe. He mixes all the pop culture references, old horror comics, modern thoughts, social media and WhatsApp jokes, and even the technology into making one film. That's quite confusing, for him and for the audiences as well. I saw the entire film but still couldn't make out if the ""RAKA"" was a sculpture/idol of Boris Karloff from Frankenstein or Anirudh Agarwal from ""Bandh Darwaja"" (1990). Gurmmeet goes over the top with everything in the film, causing an alternate fall to his own building. As a whole, Phone Bhoot builds a decent structure out of multiple designs but forgets the basic engineering rules. Who knows; it was made for ghosts, not the audience.RATING - 4/10*",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,6,3.0,"This movie (if you can call it that) is an incoherent mess of unfunny scenes. I kid you not, the funniest scene in this borefest is the cameo of the guys from fukrey movie franchise.This movie is only a poor attempt at comedy, and does not have an iota of fear-inducing horror. I doubt that even a 5 year old child would be scared by the few jump scares in this movie.There is barely a story, which only gets like 15-20 minutes of the actual runtime. The script is almost non-existent. Looks like instead of a script, somebody just lazily jotted out notes for possible scenes in the name of script, and then asked the actors to perform them as they saw fit.The acting is atrocious, and Katrina Kaif is the worst offender. To her credit, it is not for lack of trying. Jackie Shroff's character is more a caricature than a villainous character. Only Siddhant and Ishaan showed better acting chops, though that's not much to say, given how low the bar was for acting in this movie.Looking at the imdb rating (5.9 at the time of writing), I thought to give it a try on OTT, but I honestly want my time back. It's not worth a watch even on OTT. I'd recommend you to watch any of the classific indian horror comedies (e.g. Bhool Bhulaiya, Stree) rather than wasting time over this.I thought Bhoot Police (featuring Saif, Arjun, Yami Gautam and Jacqueline) was bad, but compared to Phone Bhoot, it now looks like a masterpiece.

Attract audience with powerful story, not useless gimmicks as this.I appreciate the confidence of the makers who dared to release this theatrically. Wow!

Permalink",0,0,6.0,"I have to admit that I wasn't really expecting a whole lot from this 2022 Indian horror comedy, as I sat down to watch it here in 2023. I had never heard about the movie, but I still opted to give the movie the benefit of the doubt and give it a fair chance.Turns out that writers Jasvinder Bath and Ravi Shankaran actually put together an enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline here. I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 136 minutes that the movie ran for. There were some good laughs along the way, given some hilarious situations and dialogue. Personally, I can't say that I understand why Bollywood movies cram in the obligatory dance and song routines in the middle of a narrative, and it was also present in ""Phone Bhoot"".Needless to say that, given my limited exposure to Indian cinema, then I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie. But I liked the performances I saw on the screen, and they had some good leading performers with Katrina Kaif (playing Ragini), Ishaan Khattar (playing Gullu) and Siddhant Chaturvedi (playing Major).Visually then I found ""Phone Bhoot"" to be better than I had expected and anticipated it to be. The special effects in the movie were actually fairly good. And they definitely helped to add to the overall enjoyment of the movie.The movie could have benefitted a bit from a more roundhanded trim in the editing room, because 136 minutes was a bit too long, as there were some slow patches throughout the course of the movie.My rating of director Gurmmeet Singh's 2022 horror comedy ""Phone Bhoot"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I almost hooted when Raka from Ramsay Brothers, Purana Mandir (1984) appeared to make a longish cameo. The writers have added a fair dose of pop culture references. From Katrina's Slice ads to K3G homages and Jackie Shroff playing the Hero tune on a flute, Phone Bhoot dabbles in everything, and successfully most of the times. The climax is a bit of a letdown when the villain built as this all-powerful evil is defeated in a rather silly manner. The shaky camera fights do no favour to the sequence either.Katrina is the film's star and her screen presence is solid. It is a delight to see her enjoy herself so wholeheartedly on screen. Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter nail the wicked mood as the charming Punjabi and Tamil ghostbusters. Jackie Shroff also surrenders to the absurdist mood, as he plays the iconic Hero tune in the garb of a villain.A fun watch despite all the grievances.",Warning: Spoilers,Phone Bhoot,"Comedy,Horror",5.2,2022,0,136.0,10841,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12740760/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Which is not to say that all scripts require a strong ground or glue, merely that the more outrageous scripts, the scripts with the least internal cohesion, require as much ground as they can get.Which brings us to OFFICE XMAS PARTY, one of the more blatant examples of a ""spaghetti on the wall"" script. In other words, not a lot of fine tuning was done to get this baby ready for shooting day. The writers just took every gag they could think of, threw it against the wall, and then waited to see what stuck.Some of it stuck, most did not.But Bateman and Munn hold the film together by holding the attention of the viewer. In fact, they are so effortless at it that, every now and then, for just a split second, you almost think they are acting in another movie entirely, a romcom in which they are the only characters, and you are imagining the other 400 extras in this overdone extravaganza.Is it funny?

Things could get rather festive, as long as HR don't have anything to do with it...Funny and fun. I had low expectations for this movie. It looked a lot like the silly sort of thing that Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and/or James Franco would appear in. The fact that it starred Jason Bateman (and not Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill or James Franco) gave me some hope and from the beginning, the hope was vindicated.Turns out the humour is quite irreverent and non-PC, even anti-PC, (just the way I like it) and reasonably clever in that regard. Definitely not a movie for the easily offended, especially find-an-offense types (even more reason to like it).It does get a bit predictable and silly towards the end but the first act was excellent and if that sort of quality had been maintained this could have been a classic comedy.Good for a laugh, plus for pointing out how stupid companies (and individuals) have gotten in their aversion to Christmas celebrations.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

The cast clearly had chances to improvise a large portion of the films dialogue and situations but barely any of the films payoffs actually work and at the end of the day most of the material here is below the performers talents.Looking to strike that cord between festive joy and raunchy comedy gold, Office Christmas Party ends up failing to find a winning balance in either denominator and with a collection of recycled jokes and confused stars, this is the worst kind of party where no one seems to be having fun other than the ones that organised the whole shebang.½ a Kia out of 5",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

The set up takes a long time to build to the party but the set up is better than the pay off. It's just a formless mess by that point, the ""jokes"" become every character dropping the F bomb and most of the slapstick doesn't work.Is that really still funny? How many years of R rated movies have we seen and R rated comedies? Jason Bateman gamely goes the distance playing straight man. Aniston does a one note version of her previously funnier, mean heartless bitch roles in Horrible Bosses--only there is not twist or reason for it, other than that the movie needs a villain--I guess.It's just not very clever or funny. Only Courtney B. Vance manages to make his obvious part funny. I suppose this may be a little harsh there are chuckles here and there but it never really takes off and the ""story"" and resolution are both obvious and confusing. You never get any sense that this office of people give a crap about each other or their jobs--but then we are asked to root for them?Of course there is also a fair amount of what should be black humor but only little bits of this work the rest just seem kind of ugly. This movie will try everything to see what works but not much does. A lot of fake looking snow in the film which has a flat video look to it as well. You'll just wish that all these good actors had something genuinely funny or original to do--but if that's your Christmas wish this movie won't fulfill it. You really need a script and a sense of direction---from the directors. Oh there's a guy in a sheep costume too, I give it a 3 instead of a 2 because of that.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",90,192,1.0,"Well, where do I begin with this? A comedy about office politics? Geez, where have I seen that before? If you're going to make a comedy movie these days, make it high concept, and if you can't, at least make it funny. Office Christmas Party commits the sin of being neither. Many film critics say this, but I haven't seen a comedy movie more deserving of this title... it's a 90-minute SNL skit.... oh wait, I'm sorry, Current SNL. It thinks it's a wild and crazy comedy, and oh boy, is it not. It plays it safe on nearly everything. It's as if Kate McKinnon's ultra-sensitive HR character directed the film. For a such a diverse cast of funny men and women, they are neutered of good material to work with. Jason Bateman is given nothing. Jennifer Aniston's character is one-note, though I'll give her credit for at least trying to make it work. Then, there's T.J. Miller. Dane Cook lite. He's currently being groomed as Hollywood's next hottest comedy star, and if he is, welcome to the dark ages. He is woefully unfunny. How did he make it out there? Why is it that so many amazing comedians, screenwriters and directors get turned down straight out of film school, and yet they give this man a shot? He gets the most screen time out of everyone here. It's quite sad actually. There are good performances in this, believe it or not. Kate McKinnon and the always funny Rob Corddry are the only two shining spots in this otherwise terrible film. I could go on, but why bother? I don't really need to, but when you spend 30 bucks for you and your friend to go see this in a theater, I feel the need to vent.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",40,87,4.0,"December always brings with it a raft of Yuletide yarns that are often fun but not overly great. This crude comedy continues that trend with an enjoyable yet completely disposable romp about the epic eponymous work shindig. When laidback office head Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is warned his Chicago department (inherited from Daddy) is going to be closed down unless he can secure a big contract, his solution is to throw an expensive party with live animals, lots of booze and the promise of bonuses. Of course the proverbial hits the fan and everything that can go wrong, does. Think The Hangover: Xmas Edition where we actually witnessed the night unfold before seeing everyone wake up with killer headaches and life lessons learnt. The gags fly at a million miles an hour with some sticking and some not, but it coasts by on it's super light mood and the sense that this group of extremely funny people are just having a blast hanging out on set and cracking jokes. Miller's man-child and Kate McKinnon's HR by-the-book weirdo are the standouts, and Jason Bateman's and Olivia Munn's more sensible employees are fine (although lacking chemistry as love interests), however Jennifer Aniston and Rob Corrdry are total misfires which bore throughout. The film also dovetails quickly when it gives a pimp subplot way too much attention, and the save-the-internet finale is dumb even by a popcorn comedy's standards, although the eclectic Christmas-themed soundtrack is surprisingly good. The epitome of a throwaway movie, Office Christmas Party maintains a certain level of enjoyment with its breezy vibe and the occasional laugh-out-loud gag, but is ultimately forgettable.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Unless you're a partying frat boy who spends most of his time on some kind of substance, you should stay very far away from Office Christmas Party. As I am not a partying frat boy, you might be wondering why I watched this terrible movie. I was suckered in by the ridiculous weakness of forcing myself to watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world. I thought, since she and Jason Bateman received top billing, it was going to be a Christmas edition of the Horrible Bosses films, which I did find funny. It had nothing to do with those movies; it just happened to take place in an office. Remember that group of boys in college who made student films over the weekend when they were drunk or high, and on Monday when they'd show their creation in class there would be the silence of crickets except for the creators themselves? They'd be giggling hysterically in the corner, remembering how funny their jokes and pratfalls had been at the time. And for some reason, they didn't understand or care that no one else thought their movie was funny, so they went out and did it again the next weekend. Office Christmas Party is a feature-length version of those terrible college videos. More than half the movie takes place at the party itself, and everyone drinks and does drugs to excess. The ""shenanigans"" the cast performs isn't at all funny to a sober audience who wasn't there at the time of the filming. Much as it breaks my heart, I'm forced to believe everyone involved in this movie has very bad taste.Unless you want to see the voice of Mr. Mucinex in his natural human form, I can't imagine any other legitimate reason for wanting to watch this movie.

Definitely not a movie for the easily offended, especially find-an-offense types (even more reason to like it).It does get a bit predictable and silly towards the end but the first act was excellent and if that sort of quality had been maintained this could have been a classic comedy.Good for a laugh, plus for pointing out how stupid companies (and individuals) have gotten in their aversion to Christmas celebrations.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

And to spice things up nice under the mistletoe plenty of scenes of ladies wearing sexy colored bras! The story is pretty simple just before the holiday season a witch and cruel like CEO named Carol(Jennifer Aniston)decides to destroy and cut jobs of the company that her younger care free and goof brother Clay Vanstone(T.J. Miller)works at! Only to help save the day are fellow workers business guy Josh Parker(Jason Bateman)and computer tech gal Tracey Hughes(Olivia Munn)as they plan a deal to save jobs with another company guy named Walter(Courtney B. Vance). And all of this will unfold with an epic ""Christmas"" party to save jobs! Aside from a little bit of a serious plot and theme of saving jobs, the film is a laugh feast of good times and vices as sure subplots! From the binge drinking of hard spirits and cocaine snorting to exposed body and private parts to seeing sexy women wearing red, pink, and cougar leopard print bras this party and film makes for one merry and naughty ""Christmas""!

Permalink",120,276,1.0,"If you skip one Xmas party this year then make it Office Christmas Party.A criminally unfunny and underdeveloped high concept comedy, trying to recapture that Hangover like tone, Blades of Glory directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck fail to ignite the spirit of Xmas with this comedy caper that brings the festive vibe, but fails to bring the laughs.Like receiving a lump of coal in your Xmas stocking, Party offers up an interesting proposition but delivers nothing but disappointment, as a talented cast are laboured with material that should've been left in Santa's screen writing workshop as the appealing idea of a wild office party complete with outlandish shenanigans is instead overrun by a totally unappealing story of a struggling company trying to win a big contract, with added bi-polar pimps, sister/brother in-fighting and misuses of the office 3-D printer instead taking over.It's like you're constantly waiting for the true laughs to kick in as a rather labour intensive lead up to the party hitting full swing seems to drag on for far too long then once the party actually starts we are taken away on a consistent basis to revert back to one of the films countless other side stories, it's almost as if Gordon and Speck didn't trust their core concept enough and in the end failed to even unlock any of its potential to be a festive themed riot.Making matters worse for the film's tired scripting and plotting is a collection of equally tired performances from a well renowned cast.Lead by the ever the same Jason Bateman (looking and acting like he couldn't care less), Party wastes the comedic talents of T.J Miller (who seems better suited to cameo like turns rather than high screen time), Jennifer Anniston, Rob Cordry and worst of all Kate McKinnon while Olivia Munn just feels out of place in the whole wild night. The cast clearly had chances to improvise a large portion of the films dialogue and situations but barely any of the films payoffs actually work and at the end of the day most of the material here is below the performers talents.Looking to strike that cord between festive joy and raunchy comedy gold, Office Christmas Party ends up failing to find a winning balance in either denominator and with a collection of recycled jokes and confused stars, this is the worst kind of party where no one seems to be having fun other than the ones that organised the whole shebang.½ a Kia out of 5",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

If you're going to make a comedy movie these days, make it high concept, and if you can't, at least make it funny. Office Christmas Party commits the sin of being neither. Many film critics say this, but I haven't seen a comedy movie more deserving of this title... it's a 90-minute SNL skit.... oh wait, I'm sorry, Current SNL. It thinks it's a wild and crazy comedy, and oh boy, is it not. It plays it safe on nearly everything. It's as if Kate McKinnon's ultra-sensitive HR character directed the film. For a such a diverse cast of funny men and women, they are neutered of good material to work with. Jason Bateman is given nothing. Jennifer Aniston's character is one-note, though I'll give her credit for at least trying to make it work. Then, there's T.J. Miller. Dane Cook lite. He's currently being groomed as Hollywood's next hottest comedy star, and if he is, welcome to the dark ages. He is woefully unfunny. How did he make it out there? Why is it that so many amazing comedians, screenwriters and directors get turned down straight out of film school, and yet they give this man a shot? He gets the most screen time out of everyone here. It's quite sad actually. There are good performances in this, believe it or not. Kate McKinnon and the always funny Rob Corddry are the only two shining spots in this otherwise terrible film. I could go on, but why bother?

Permalink",40,87,4.0,"December always brings with it a raft of Yuletide yarns that are often fun but not overly great. This crude comedy continues that trend with an enjoyable yet completely disposable romp about the epic eponymous work shindig. When laidback office head Clay Vanstone (T.J.

Of course the proverbial hits the fan and everything that can go wrong, does. Think The Hangover: Xmas Edition where we actually witnessed the night unfold before seeing everyone wake up with killer headaches and life lessons learnt. The gags fly at a million miles an hour with some sticking and some not, but it coasts by on it's super light mood and the sense that this group of extremely funny people are just having a blast hanging out on set and cracking jokes. Miller's man-child and Kate McKinnon's HR by-the-book weirdo are the standouts, and Jason Bateman's and Olivia Munn's more sensible employees are fine (although lacking chemistry as love interests), however Jennifer Aniston and Rob Corrdry are total misfires which bore throughout. The film also dovetails quickly when it gives a pimp subplot way too much attention, and the save-the-internet finale is dumb even by a popcorn comedy's standards, although the eclectic Christmas-themed soundtrack is surprisingly good. The epitome of a throwaway movie, Office Christmas Party maintains a certain level of enjoyment with its breezy vibe and the occasional laugh-out-loud gag, but is ultimately forgettable.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Unless you're a partying frat boy who spends most of his time on some kind of substance, you should stay very far away from Office Christmas Party. As I am not a partying frat boy, you might be wondering why I watched this terrible movie. I was suckered in by the ridiculous weakness of forcing myself to watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world. I thought, since she and Jason Bateman received top billing, it was going to be a Christmas edition of the Horrible Bosses films, which I did find funny. It had nothing to do with those movies; it just happened to take place in an office. Remember that group of boys in college who made student films over the weekend when they were drunk or high, and on Monday when they'd show their creation in class there would be the silence of crickets except for the creators themselves? They'd be giggling hysterically in the corner, remembering how funny their jokes and pratfalls had been at the time. And for some reason, they didn't understand or care that no one else thought their movie was funny, so they went out and did it again the next weekend. Office Christmas Party is a feature-length version of those terrible college videos. More than half the movie takes place at the party itself, and everyone drinks and does drugs to excess. The ""shenanigans"" the cast performs isn't at all funny to a sober audience who wasn't there at the time of the filming. Much as it breaks my heart, I'm forced to believe everyone involved in this movie has very bad taste.Unless you want to see the voice of Mr. Mucinex in his natural human form, I can't imagine any other legitimate reason for wanting to watch this movie.

Permalink",6,13,5.0,"Many people will admit to doing embarrassing things at an office Christmas party, so it is the perfect subject for a deliberately over-the-top festive comedy film, and it makes sense to have an ensemble cast, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck (Blades of Glory, The Switch). Basically, Zenotek is a cut-throat technology firm, the Chicago branch's Chief Technical Officer, Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), is finalising his divorce. The company has failed to meet its quarterly quota, and interim CEO Carol Vanstone (Jennifer Aniston) is threatening to lay off staff, cut bonuses, cancel the annual Christmas party, and perhaps even shut down the branch. Her brother, branch manager Clay (T.J. Miller), is desperate to keep his staff. Josh and Clay, along with head of tech, Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn), propose partnering with financial giant Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance), to save the struggling company. Walter is pleased with the pitch, but concerned with another recent branch closure at Zenotek, and feels the company is more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to their Christmas party in hopes of showing him that their company is in good standing. Before leaving town, Carol offers Josh a position at her New York headquarters to which he declines. Clay funds a highly excessive Christmas party, much to the annoyance of Mary (Kate McKinnon), the head of Human Resources. Joel (Sam Richardson) is the evening's DJ, but the party struggles to pick up even with Tracey inviting Chicago Bulls player Jimmy Butler as a friend. Throughout the party, various employees cut loose: Nate (Karan Soni) tries to impress his colleagues Tim (Andrew Leeds) and Drew (Oliver Cooper) by hiring an escort named Savannah (Abbey Lee) to pretend to be his girlfriend; Clay's assistant and single-mom Allison (Vanessa Bayer) attempts to hook up with new hire Fred (Randall Park); and customer service supervisor Jeremy (Rob Corddry) cuts loose on the dance floor with Mary, whom he previously despised. Josh and Tracey get stuck on the roof and nearly kiss before Jeremy interrupts them. While initially reluctant, Walter is inadvertently doused with cocaine when it is accidentally fed into a snow machine and succumbs to his free-spirited nature. Clay wins over Walter's business, and the celebration gradually grows more chaotic as employees begin partaking in orgies, damaging company property, and doing drugs. Carol's flight is cancelled due to weather, and she rushes back to the office when she hears about the party from an Uber driver, who took people to the party. Though Carol is initially impressed with receiving Walter's business, Walter injures himself attempting to swing off a balcony after a conversation with Clay, and is later discovered to have been fired from his firm after his sudden business closure, making the proposed contract meaningless and leaving Zenotek helpless. Carol decides then and there to shut down the branch. She also reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay, although he didn't accept it, the surrounding employees angrily shun him. Clay leaves to find another party and rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp, Trina (Jillian Bell), who is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person. Josh, Tracey, Mary, and Carol race off to save Clay. One of the guests learns that the branch is being terminated and convinces everyone to throw out and destroy all the company equipment and burn everything in sight, forcing security guard Carla (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) to stop the unruly, now destructive and rebellious party. Clay with Trina's group and Josh with his group end up in a car chase together, and a near attempt at a jump over an open bridge gap. Both end up crashing into each other and causing a power outage across the entire city. Trina and Savannah are arrested for their crimes, while Clay is taken to the hospital. In the wake of the internet blackout, Tracey realises how to run a new innovation she's been working on for several years that combines internet Wi-Fi with wired connections through the city's power grid, which had previously failed due to real-world interference of the existing internet signals. They race back to the destroyed office to set up her tech, and when it works, internet is restored to Chicago. This new innovation saves the jobs of the entire team, with Clay apologising for how his father treated Carol. Walter, in the same hospital as Clay, agrees to join the team, while Josh and Tracey kiss share a kiss in the ruins of their office. Jeremy opens up to Mary, and Nate and Allison agree to go on a date. The whole group meets Carol and Clay as he's released from the hospital, and they all go out for breakfast, driving recklessly on the way. Also starring Jamie Chung as Meghan, Chloe Wepper as Kelsey, Matt Walsh as Ezra, Ben Falcone as Doctor, Fortune Feimster as Lonny and Michael Tourek as Alexei. Bateman, Aniston, Miller, McKinnon, Corddry and the other recognisable stars all play their parts, there is not very much in the way of a story or plot, but it doesn't matter, it is all about the chaotic behaviour as the staff get drunk and high, engaging in embarrassing and humiliating behaviour, there is even the traditional photocopying of body parts, it is likeable enough, a reasonably funny seasonal comedy.

Permalink",19,46,4.0,"Remind me never to go to an office Christmas party – or any office party for that matter. I'm just not willing to risk it. If the examples that appear on the big screen are any indication, these events are, at best, strange – or, at worst, downright scary. In 1988, ""Die Hard"" showed us a Christmas party that was taken over by terrorists! 2016's aptly named ""Office Christmas Party"" (R, 1:45) features people jousting with Christmas trees, heavy objects falling from tall buildings, people trying to jump tall bridges with their cars, pimps with guns – and party guests getting hospitalized! No, I don't ever want to go to any office Christmas parties, and if you're smart, given these cinematic cautionary tales, you shouldn't either. But should you go to the movie ""Office Christmas Party""? Well, that is the question now, isn't it? Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is in trouble. He's the manager of the original branch of national technology company Zenotech, but his branch is struggling to pull its weight and his joyless and mean-spirited sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), the CEO of Zenotech (since Clay and Carol's father died) is threatening to close down the branch – or at least put a big lump of coal in the stockings of many of its employees. Clay, along with Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), his Chief Technical Officer and best friend, tries to figure out a way to save the branch. Josh's assistant, Tracey (Olivia Munn), thinks she has an innovation idea that could do the trick, but Josh thinks that her idea isn't ready to demonstrate. Instead, the three of them focus on the strategy of winning the business of prospective client Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance).Clay, Josh and Tracey decide to show Walter that they are the kind of people he wants to deal with, by inviting him to their office Christmas party – and making it the funnest office party ever. As they're about the business of pulling together the party of the century in five hours and making it into the most fun their colleagues have ever had with their clothes on (for those who keep them on, that is), several of the people of Zenotech have their own individual struggles to deal with. Besides their business rivalry, there's a deep-seated sibling rivalry between Clay and Carol. Josh is newly divorced and is starting to make eyes at Tracey. Meanwhile, a nerdy employee named Nate (Karan Soni) keeps talking about a girlfriend whom others believe he has made up, while an employee named Allison (Vanessa Bayer) and another named Fred (Randall Park) are flirting with each other and a human resources representative named Mary Winetoss (Kate McKinnon) is zealously monitoring the behavior of all her co-workers.This movie is a semi-enjoyable, but semi-lazy holiday comedy. The story can be described as a mash-up of ""Unfinished Business"" (2015), ""Project X"" (2012), ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011), ""Billy Madison"" (1995) and ""Die Hard"". The basic plot is reasonably creative, but the script is mostly uninspired, unrealistic and predictable and the directing lacks energy. The comedy comes from a combination of juvenile hijinks, sexual humor, politically incorrect satire, wild sight gags and slapstick. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, but too much of the humor is uninspired and unfunny. Most of the cast members are not very effective, with the notable exception of McKinnon (showing off another version of her uptight-slash-odd comic persona), while Miller and Bateman hold their own, as do Jillian Bell (playing that aforementioned gun-toting pimp) and Da'Vine Joy Randolph (as a pleasant but tough security guard). The cast also includes a fair number of little known and unknown comic actors who show potential. If you get invited to ""Office Christmas Party"" by a friend and you don't expect too much, you may well have some fun, but this is one party that you probably shouldn't reshuffle your plans in order to attend.

An annual event that we've all been to and one that may lead to you seeing your colleagues in a new light, the quiet one may let their inner party animal out or the stingy boss may be the one buying everyone a drink at the bar. This comedy, aptly titled Office Christmas Party, dials up the debauchery to eleven with a talented comedic cast, and the results are very mixed to say the least.Clay Vanstone (T. J. Miller) is the Chicago branch manager for Zenotek, an IT sales company that's leaking money at an alarming rate. When his sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), who is also the CEO of Zenotek, shows up and threatens to shut the Chicago branch down, Clay must think of a way to convince Carol to change her mind.With the help of his friends Josh (Jason Bateman) and Tracey (Olivia Munn), Clay decides to throw an epic Christmas party for his employees to attract a big money client to become a partner. It isn't long before things get out of hand and with hardly any responsible adults in sight, the Chicago branch may be shutting itself down.The biggest frustration for me while watching Office Christmas Party was just how utterly wasted each and every one of this talented cast is by such a mediocre script and uninspired story. At this stage in their careers, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, who are both very good comedic actors, are sleepwalking their way through material like this for a simple pay day. The best comedic performances are given by T. J. Miller and Kate McKinnon however, even they are both let down by a lack of quality material. It's an unfortunate trait in comedies nowadays that they either seem like they don't put any effort in or they try way too hard.It's a strange mix of both in Office Christmas Party that makes it suffer. Don't get me wrong, I definitely laughed at some parts but for the most part, this film was just trying to raise a few cheap laughs from the audience.A disappointing experience overall, Office Christmas Party is one film you shouldn't try to emulate in real life, unless you want to get fired from your job.

The only problem is that it doesn't go as planned so they propose to have a massive Christmas party to show the person how great their company can be.OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY is pretty much what you'd expect from a recent Jason Bateman film. The screenplay is certainly under developed but at the same time the film really isn't trying to be anything other than an offensive and funny comedy. For the most part I'd say about forty percent of the jokes worked so the film is okay and worth sitting through as long as you aren't expecting some sort of masterpiece.As I said, not every joke works but I do think enough of them did to make the film worth sitting through. Once the party gets started we obviously get a lot of drunken humor with people doing very stupid things for jokes. Some of the funniest moments involve Courtney B. Vance who plays the man that the leads are trying to impress. I won't say what happens to him but Vance is quite funny here. I also thought Miller was quite good in his role and both Bateman and Olivia Munn are good for what they're asked to do. Aniston plays pretty much the same type of character she did in HORRIBLE BOSSES but she was at least fun to watch.The story here is pretty weak and especially a third act where our lead is taken hostage by a hooker and her pimp.

It was directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon; and it was written by Justin Malen, Laura Solon, Dan Mazer, Jon Lucas, Scott Moore and Timothy Dowling. The film stars Jason Bateman, T.J. Miller, Olivia Munn, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney B. Vance, Kate McKinnan, Jillian Bell, Rob Corddry, Vanessa Bayer, Karan Soni and Randall Park (Bateman and Aniston also starred in Speck and Gordon's last movie 'THE SWITCH'). It received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has done well at the Box Office (so far). I enjoyed it.Clay Vanstone (Miller) is the branch manager of Zenotek's Chicago branch. His sister Carol (Aniston) is the company's intermediate CEO. She also resents Clay, because Clay was always their father's favorite (who recently passed away). Carol is threatening to make huge cuts, to the business, and possibly shut down Clay's branch; unless they can meet her new quarterly quota. One way, they could possibly do this, is by partnering with Walter Davis (Vance). Clay thinks the best way to impress him is to throw an awesome office Christmas party; which he, and his technical officers (Bateman and Munn), invite him to.The movie is pretty funny (in places) and the cast is all awesome in it (especially Miller). I wouldn't call it a Christmas classic though; only time will tell I guess, but I seriously doubt it. It is well made though, it has a great premise and it's very humorous (from time to time). None of the jokes are that bad either (and it's never painful to sit though), that's a big positive in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",8,17,5.0,"Now, I've been to some parties in my time, parties that have included fires on the roof of patios, blowing up a garden, chanting with the Hare Krishna, getting on the radio, bum fighting and defecating in inappropriate places. Witnessing one person recite the entire lyrics to LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"" whilst stepping over comatose revellers, people dancing naked on tables, drunkard piggy backs and beds being thrown from hotel windows! Some of which I have shamefully been planned or host to. So, is the Office Christmas Party an event I see actually happening? Partly yes. In fact, I found a lot of it clichéd and lame, taking all the usual craziness that occurs at office parties and tried to turn the volume up to eleven, like the writers have drawn from their own experiences or trawled through countless stories of other people's epic parties and amalgamating them all into one raving lunatic party. It's like the uncut version of the office party in Wolf Of Wall Street who's having to share office space with the Channel 4 news room. T.J. Miller is Clay, big kid, boss of a major hi-tech branch in Chicago only answerable to uber- bitch sister and CEO Carol, played by Jennifer Anniston, who wants to close his branch down unless he can close the deal of the century. Obviously, throwing the Christmas party of the century is the answer. He's not alone with departmental, straight-laced manager Josh (Jason Bateman) and tech- innovator and screen eye candy, Tracey (Olivia Munn) among a cast of stereotypical, office misfits. Bateman does his usual, laid back, unsurprised lead who looks more like he just wandered into the wrong movie. Munn is the stunning star here, though, like Bateman, seem too serious to suit the rest of the movie. I like the principles Clay strives for, a boss after my own heart, and Branson's too in a way, staff first, before customers and even share holders because of you look after the staff, you shouldn't have to worry about the customers. It's actually quite a true representation of how the corporate world of today has diminished morale and be profit focused. I get business is business, but they're lost something crucial along the way; valuing staff.The trailer is a little misleading with Kate McKinnon, those expecting the same quirky craziness she gave in this year's Ghostbusters might be disappointed but she's still very funny, embodying an entire HR department with a watchful eye. Maybe the trailer should have been a teaser, daring to tempt viewers instead of showing some of the key parts which unfortunately makes the film predictable and anticlimactic. As expected, it comes with a heavy soundtrack, dropping decent beats, especially the festive themed ""Deck Da Club"" from the Ying Yang Twins but it was disappointing to see Theodore Shapiro's name in the opening credits and not really hear his score. His work for Secret Life of Walter Mitty was one of my fave scores of 2013. It's funny, but not the funniest film of the year by a long shot. The trailer suggested more and I wanted more.

Permalink",11,28,2.0,"The owner of an I.T. company died, and that resulted in the daughter of the owner, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), as acting CEO and the son Clay (T.J. Miller) was given a New York branch. Sibling rivalry has Carol and Clay at odds. Carol sees the last quarter reports and wants to fire everyone, and no one get bonuses, and, of course, no Christmas party. She says that if someone can come up with an idea to bring in more money all will remain the same. No one can. Josh (Jason Bateman) is one of the company officers. Clay and Josh figure that if they can hire Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance) who can bring in millions, all will be saved. A Christmas party is born in spite of Carol and Walter Davis is to be invited to get him to join the company. I only took this out because I saw Jason Bateman's name. He is the only one in Hollywood who has the timing for whatever job he is hired for. Regardless of the movie he is in, watch him closely. The movie may be pure crap (as this one is), but he will shine. He knows timing. I would recommend that he set up a school to teach so-called-comedians of today how to do timing so they don't embarrass themselves as they do now. Okay, that said the first half of this movie is okay, some language, but nothing to point to shutting it down. However, when the party starts and seems to never end you will hear language to be sure, but you will see very crude and vulgar visuals with people, some naked, too. We know that Hollywood has sunk to lows they can never recover from and this movie proves that once again. In a word Hollywood knows nothing about how to do comedy as they are more interested in Shock Value because they think that is funny. Did I laugh at anything? Absolutely not. There was nothing funny or even clever. The title should have been Office Christmas Party from Hell.I will say that Bateman disappointed me (Bad Jason) doing a scene simulating a BJ on an ice sculpture that looks like Santa. Yes, the crowd put him up to it, but hey, it was in the script. The script needed a rewrite as soon as the party started. The rest of the time, he as Josh, was okay. Again, watch him. He knows timing. Jennifer Aniston as Carol was okay as a out-of-control CEO, but when she says FU to a little girl at an airport, I couldn't believe I heard that directed to a little girl. Her parents must be so proud she was in a movie, right?There is a twist later on, but who cares? A vehicle crash shuts down the internet for the entire city and some employees figure out a way to get it back and does this save the movie? Goodness no. And again, who cares?Notables who did nothing to help this along: Olivia Munn as Tracey; and Kate McKinnon as Mary.There really isn't anything left to say. (2/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes.

In other words, not a lot of fine tuning was done to get this baby ready for shooting day. The writers just took every gag they could think of, threw it against the wall, and then waited to see what stuck.Some of it stuck, most did not.But Bateman and Munn hold the film together by holding the attention of the viewer.

Definitely not a movie for the easily offended, especially find-an-offense types (even more reason to like it).It does get a bit predictable and silly towards the end but the first act was excellent and if that sort of quality had been maintained this could have been a classic comedy.Good for a laugh, plus for pointing out how stupid companies (and individuals) have gotten in their aversion to Christmas celebrations.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",120,276,1.0,"If you skip one Xmas party this year then make it Office Christmas Party.A criminally unfunny and underdeveloped high concept comedy, trying to recapture that Hangover like tone, Blades of Glory directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck fail to ignite the spirit of Xmas with this comedy caper that brings the festive vibe, but fails to bring the laughs.Like receiving a lump of coal in your Xmas stocking, Party offers up an interesting proposition but delivers nothing but disappointment, as a talented cast are laboured with material that should've been left in Santa's screen writing workshop as the appealing idea of a wild office party complete with outlandish shenanigans is instead overrun by a totally unappealing story of a struggling company trying to win a big contract, with added bi-polar pimps, sister/brother in-fighting and misuses of the office 3-D printer instead taking over.It's like you're constantly waiting for the true laughs to kick in as a rather labour intensive lead up to the party hitting full swing seems to drag on for far too long then once the party actually starts we are taken away on a consistent basis to revert back to one of the films countless other side stories, it's almost as if Gordon and Speck didn't trust their core concept enough and in the end failed to even unlock any of its potential to be a festive themed riot.Making matters worse for the film's tired scripting and plotting is a collection of equally tired performances from a well renowned cast.Lead by the ever the same Jason Bateman (looking and acting like he couldn't care less), Party wastes the comedic talents of T.J Miller (who seems better suited to cameo like turns rather than high screen time), Jennifer Anniston, Rob Cordry and worst of all Kate McKinnon while Olivia Munn just feels out of place in the whole wild night. The cast clearly had chances to improvise a large portion of the films dialogue and situations but barely any of the films payoffs actually work and at the end of the day most of the material here is below the performers talents.Looking to strike that cord between festive joy and raunchy comedy gold, Office Christmas Party ends up failing to find a winning balance in either denominator and with a collection of recycled jokes and confused stars, this is the worst kind of party where no one seems to be having fun other than the ones that organised the whole shebang.½ a Kia out of 5",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Only Courtney B. Vance manages to make his obvious part funny. I suppose this may be a little harsh there are chuckles here and there but it never really takes off and the ""story"" and resolution are both obvious and confusing. You never get any sense that this office of people give a crap about each other or their jobs--but then we are asked to root for them?Of course there is also a fair amount of what should be black humor but only little bits of this work the rest just seem kind of ugly. This movie will try everything to see what works but not much does. A lot of fake looking snow in the film which has a flat video look to it as well. You'll just wish that all these good actors had something genuinely funny or original to do--but if that's your Christmas wish this movie won't fulfill it.

Permalink",90,192,1.0,"Well, where do I begin with this? A comedy about office politics? Geez, where have I seen that before? If you're going to make a comedy movie these days, make it high concept, and if you can't, at least make it funny. Office Christmas Party commits the sin of being neither. Many film critics say this, but I haven't seen a comedy movie more deserving of this title... it's a 90-minute SNL skit.... oh wait, I'm sorry, Current SNL. It thinks it's a wild and crazy comedy, and oh boy, is it not. It plays it safe on nearly everything. It's as if Kate McKinnon's ultra-sensitive HR character directed the film. For a such a diverse cast of funny men and women, they are neutered of good material to work with. Jason Bateman is given nothing. Jennifer Aniston's character is one-note, though I'll give her credit for at least trying to make it work. Then, there's T.J. Miller. Dane Cook lite. He's currently being groomed as Hollywood's next hottest comedy star, and if he is, welcome to the dark ages. He is woefully unfunny. How did he make it out there? Why is it that so many amazing comedians, screenwriters and directors get turned down straight out of film school, and yet they give this man a shot? He gets the most screen time out of everyone here. It's quite sad actually. There are good performances in this, believe it or not. Kate McKinnon and the always funny Rob Corddry are the only two shining spots in this otherwise terrible film. I could go on, but why bother?

Permalink",40,87,4.0,"December always brings with it a raft of Yuletide yarns that are often fun but not overly great. This crude comedy continues that trend with an enjoyable yet completely disposable romp about the epic eponymous work shindig. When laidback office head Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is warned his Chicago department (inherited from Daddy) is going to be closed down unless he can secure a big contract, his solution is to throw an expensive party with live animals, lots of booze and the promise of bonuses. Of course the proverbial hits the fan and everything that can go wrong, does. Think The Hangover: Xmas Edition where we actually witnessed the night unfold before seeing everyone wake up with killer headaches and life lessons learnt. The gags fly at a million miles an hour with some sticking and some not, but it coasts by on it's super light mood and the sense that this group of extremely funny people are just having a blast hanging out on set and cracking jokes. Miller's man-child and Kate McKinnon's HR by-the-book weirdo are the standouts, and Jason Bateman's and Olivia Munn's more sensible employees are fine (although lacking chemistry as love interests), however Jennifer Aniston and Rob Corrdry are total misfires which bore throughout. The film also dovetails quickly when it gives a pimp subplot way too much attention, and the save-the-internet finale is dumb even by a popcorn comedy's standards, although the eclectic Christmas-themed soundtrack is surprisingly good. The epitome of a throwaway movie, Office Christmas Party maintains a certain level of enjoyment with its breezy vibe and the occasional laugh-out-loud gag, but is ultimately forgettable.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Unless you're a partying frat boy who spends most of his time on some kind of substance, you should stay very far away from Office Christmas Party. As I am not a partying frat boy, you might be wondering why I watched this terrible movie. I was suckered in by the ridiculous weakness of forcing myself to watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world. I thought, since she and Jason Bateman received top billing, it was going to be a Christmas edition of the Horrible Bosses films, which I did find funny. It had nothing to do with those movies; it just happened to take place in an office. Remember that group of boys in college who made student films over the weekend when they were drunk or high, and on Monday when they'd show their creation in class there would be the silence of crickets except for the creators themselves? They'd be giggling hysterically in the corner, remembering how funny their jokes and pratfalls had been at the time. And for some reason, they didn't understand or care that no one else thought their movie was funny, so they went out and did it again the next weekend. Office Christmas Party is a feature-length version of those terrible college videos. More than half the movie takes place at the party itself, and everyone drinks and does drugs to excess. The ""shenanigans"" the cast performs isn't at all funny to a sober audience who wasn't there at the time of the filming. Much as it breaks my heart, I'm forced to believe everyone involved in this movie has very bad taste.Unless you want to see the voice of Mr. Mucinex in his natural human form, I can't imagine any other legitimate reason for wanting to watch this movie.

Basically, Zenotek is a cut-throat technology firm, the Chicago branch's Chief Technical Officer, Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), is finalising his divorce.

Josh and Clay, along with head of tech, Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn), propose partnering with financial giant Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance), to save the struggling company. Walter is pleased with the pitch, but concerned with another recent branch closure at Zenotek, and feels the company is more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to their Christmas party in hopes of showing him that their company is in good standing. Before leaving town, Carol offers Josh a position at her New York headquarters to which he declines. Clay funds a highly excessive Christmas party, much to the annoyance of Mary (Kate McKinnon), the head of Human Resources. Joel (Sam Richardson) is the evening's DJ, but the party struggles to pick up even with Tracey inviting Chicago Bulls player Jimmy Butler as a friend. Throughout the party, various employees cut loose: Nate (Karan Soni) tries to impress his colleagues Tim (Andrew Leeds) and Drew (Oliver Cooper) by hiring an escort named Savannah (Abbey Lee) to pretend to be his girlfriend; Clay's assistant and single-mom Allison (Vanessa Bayer) attempts to hook up with new hire Fred (Randall Park); and customer service supervisor Jeremy (Rob Corddry) cuts loose on the dance floor with Mary, whom he previously despised. Josh and Tracey get stuck on the roof and nearly kiss before Jeremy interrupts them. While initially reluctant, Walter is inadvertently doused with cocaine when it is accidentally fed into a snow machine and succumbs to his free-spirited nature. Clay wins over Walter's business, and the celebration gradually grows more chaotic as employees begin partaking in orgies, damaging company property, and doing drugs. Carol's flight is cancelled due to weather, and she rushes back to the office when she hears about the party from an Uber driver, who took people to the party. Though Carol is initially impressed with receiving Walter's business, Walter injures himself attempting to swing off a balcony after a conversation with Clay, and is later discovered to have been fired from his firm after his sudden business closure, making the proposed contract meaningless and leaving Zenotek helpless. Carol decides then and there to shut down the branch. She also reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay, although he didn't accept it, the surrounding employees angrily shun him. Clay leaves to find another party and rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp, Trina (Jillian Bell), who is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person. Josh, Tracey, Mary, and Carol race off to save Clay. One of the guests learns that the branch is being terminated and convinces everyone to throw out and destroy all the company equipment and burn everything in sight, forcing security guard Carla (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) to stop the unruly, now destructive and rebellious party. Clay with Trina's group and Josh with his group end up in a car chase together, and a near attempt at a jump over an open bridge gap. Both end up crashing into each other and causing a power outage across the entire city. Trina and Savannah are arrested for their crimes, while Clay is taken to the hospital. In the wake of the internet blackout, Tracey realises how to run a new innovation she's been working on for several years that combines internet Wi-Fi with wired connections through the city's power grid, which had previously failed due to real-world interference of the existing internet signals. They race back to the destroyed office to set up her tech, and when it works, internet is restored to Chicago. This new innovation saves the jobs of the entire team, with Clay apologising for how his father treated Carol. Walter, in the same hospital as Clay, agrees to join the team, while Josh and Tracey kiss share a kiss in the ruins of their office. Jeremy opens up to Mary, and Nate and Allison agree to go on a date. The whole group meets Carol and Clay as he's released from the hospital, and they all go out for breakfast, driving recklessly on the way. Also starring Jamie Chung as Meghan, Chloe Wepper as Kelsey, Matt Walsh as Ezra, Ben Falcone as Doctor, Fortune Feimster as Lonny and Michael Tourek as Alexei. Bateman, Aniston, Miller, McKinnon, Corddry and the other recognisable stars all play their parts, there is not very much in the way of a story or plot, but it doesn't matter, it is all about the chaotic behaviour as the staff get drunk and high, engaging in embarrassing and humiliating behaviour, there is even the traditional photocopying of body parts, it is likeable enough, a reasonably funny seasonal comedy.

Whilst this format allows for a number of raunchy punch-lines, the thin plot leads to the movie stagnating,due to there being little options for progression in the relationships of the workers.Attempting to save their jobs with a wild party, co-directors Josh Gordon & Will Speck deck the halls with glittering neon lights that shine an anything goes,free for all atmosphere on the event. Joined by a sassy Abbey Lee as Savannah and a dead-pan Kate McKinnon as Mary, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston give the flick a much-needed glass of festive cheer as Carol Vanstone and Josh Parker,thanks to Aniston and Bateman retaining their snappy black comedy delivery from their past team-ups,which they unwrap at the office X-Mas party.",Warning: Spoilers,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",19,46,4.0,"Remind me never to go to an office Christmas party – or any office party for that matter. I'm just not willing to risk it. If the examples that appear on the big screen are any indication, these events are, at best, strange – or, at worst, downright scary. In 1988, ""Die Hard"" showed us a Christmas party that was taken over by terrorists! 2016's aptly named ""Office Christmas Party"" (R, 1:45) features people jousting with Christmas trees, heavy objects falling from tall buildings, people trying to jump tall bridges with their cars, pimps with guns – and party guests getting hospitalized! No, I don't ever want to go to any office Christmas parties, and if you're smart, given these cinematic cautionary tales, you shouldn't either. But should you go to the movie ""Office Christmas Party""? Well, that is the question now, isn't it? Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is in trouble. He's the manager of the original branch of national technology company Zenotech, but his branch is struggling to pull its weight and his joyless and mean-spirited sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), the CEO of Zenotech (since Clay and Carol's father died) is threatening to close down the branch – or at least put a big lump of coal in the stockings of many of its employees. Clay, along with Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), his Chief Technical Officer and best friend, tries to figure out a way to save the branch. Josh's assistant, Tracey (Olivia Munn), thinks she has an innovation idea that could do the trick, but Josh thinks that her idea isn't ready to demonstrate. Instead, the three of them focus on the strategy of winning the business of prospective client Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance).Clay, Josh and Tracey decide to show Walter that they are the kind of people he wants to deal with, by inviting him to their office Christmas party – and making it the funnest office party ever. As they're about the business of pulling together the party of the century in five hours and making it into the most fun their colleagues have ever had with their clothes on (for those who keep them on, that is), several of the people of Zenotech have their own individual struggles to deal with. Besides their business rivalry, there's a deep-seated sibling rivalry between Clay and Carol. Josh is newly divorced and is starting to make eyes at Tracey. Meanwhile, a nerdy employee named Nate (Karan Soni) keeps talking about a girlfriend whom others believe he has made up, while an employee named Allison (Vanessa Bayer) and another named Fred (Randall Park) are flirting with each other and a human resources representative named Mary Winetoss (Kate McKinnon) is zealously monitoring the behavior of all her co-workers.This movie is a semi-enjoyable, but semi-lazy holiday comedy. The story can be described as a mash-up of ""Unfinished Business"" (2015), ""Project X"" (2012), ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011), ""Billy Madison"" (1995) and ""Die Hard"". The basic plot is reasonably creative, but the script is mostly uninspired, unrealistic and predictable and the directing lacks energy. The comedy comes from a combination of juvenile hijinks, sexual humor, politically incorrect satire, wild sight gags and slapstick. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, but too much of the humor is uninspired and unfunny. Most of the cast members are not very effective, with the notable exception of McKinnon (showing off another version of her uptight-slash-odd comic persona), while Miller and Bateman hold their own, as do Jillian Bell (playing that aforementioned gun-toting pimp) and Da'Vine Joy Randolph (as a pleasant but tough security guard). The cast also includes a fair number of little known and unknown comic actors who show potential. If you get invited to ""Office Christmas Party"" by a friend and you don't expect too much, you may well have some fun, but this is one party that you probably shouldn't reshuffle your plans in order to attend.

An annual event that we've all been to and one that may lead to you seeing your colleagues in a new light, the quiet one may let their inner party animal out or the stingy boss may be the one buying everyone a drink at the bar. This comedy, aptly titled Office Christmas Party, dials up the debauchery to eleven with a talented comedic cast, and the results are very mixed to say the least.Clay Vanstone (T. J. Miller) is the Chicago branch manager for Zenotek, an IT sales company that's leaking money at an alarming rate. When his sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), who is also the CEO of Zenotek, shows up and threatens to shut the Chicago branch down, Clay must think of a way to convince Carol to change her mind.With the help of his friends Josh (Jason Bateman) and Tracey (Olivia Munn), Clay decides to throw an epic Christmas party for his employees to attract a big money client to become a partner. It isn't long before things get out of hand and with hardly any responsible adults in sight, the Chicago branch may be shutting itself down.The biggest frustration for me while watching Office Christmas Party was just how utterly wasted each and every one of this talented cast is by such a mediocre script and uninspired story. At this stage in their careers, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, who are both very good comedic actors, are sleepwalking their way through material like this for a simple pay day. The best comedic performances are given by T. J. Miller and Kate McKinnon however, even they are both let down by a lack of quality material. It's an unfortunate trait in comedies nowadays that they either seem like they don't put any effort in or they try way too hard.It's a strange mix of both in Office Christmas Party that makes it suffer. Don't get me wrong, I definitely laughed at some parts but for the most part, this film was just trying to raise a few cheap laughs from the audience.A disappointing experience overall, Office Christmas Party is one film you shouldn't try to emulate in real life, unless you want to get fired from your job.

The only problem is that it doesn't go as planned so they propose to have a massive Christmas party to show the person how great their company can be.OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY is pretty much what you'd expect from a recent Jason Bateman film. The screenplay is certainly under developed but at the same time the film really isn't trying to be anything other than an offensive and funny comedy. For the most part I'd say about forty percent of the jokes worked so the film is okay and worth sitting through as long as you aren't expecting some sort of masterpiece.As I said, not every joke works but I do think enough of them did to make the film worth sitting through. Once the party gets started we obviously get a lot of drunken humor with people doing very stupid things for jokes. Some of the funniest moments involve Courtney B. Vance who plays the man that the leads are trying to impress. I won't say what happens to him but Vance is quite funny here. I also thought Miller was quite good in his role and both Bateman and Olivia Munn are good for what they're asked to do. Aniston plays pretty much the same type of character she did in HORRIBLE BOSSES but she was at least fun to watch.The story here is pretty weak and especially a third act where our lead is taken hostage by a hooker and her pimp.

Permalink",7,20,8.0,"'OFFICE Christmas PARTY': Four Stars (Out of Five)A Christmas comedy film about a group of desperate employees, that are trying to save their company's branch (from being closed) by throwing an awesome office Christmas party (to attract a potential big client). It was directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon; and it was written by Justin Malen, Laura Solon, Dan Mazer, Jon Lucas, Scott Moore and Timothy Dowling. The film stars Jason Bateman, T.J. Miller, Olivia Munn, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney B. Vance, Kate McKinnan, Jillian Bell, Rob Corddry, Vanessa Bayer, Karan Soni and Randall Park (Bateman and Aniston also starred in Speck and Gordon's last movie 'THE SWITCH'). It received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has done well at the Box Office (so far). I enjoyed it.Clay Vanstone (Miller) is the branch manager of Zenotek's Chicago branch. His sister Carol (Aniston) is the company's intermediate CEO. She also resents Clay, because Clay was always their father's favorite (who recently passed away). Carol is threatening to make huge cuts, to the business, and possibly shut down Clay's branch; unless they can meet her new quarterly quota. One way, they could possibly do this, is by partnering with Walter Davis (Vance). Clay thinks the best way to impress him is to throw an awesome office Christmas party; which he, and his technical officers (Bateman and Munn), invite him to.The movie is pretty funny (in places) and the cast is all awesome in it (especially Miller). I wouldn't call it a Christmas classic though; only time will tell I guess, but I seriously doubt it. It is well made though, it has a great premise and it's very humorous (from time to time). None of the jokes are that bad either (and it's never painful to sit though), that's a big positive in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

It looks like someone put The hangover movies + Bachelor Party + whatever in the mixer and then this! Just another ""movie-shake"", nothing delicious about it. Cliché jokes, nothing much to enjoy. Maybe in the future we movie goers will be eligible to partial or even full refund for buying stall products like this. I really waited and waited, expecting something would happen and maybe, maybe I would laugh and nothing. I am not mad, angry, I am just surprised that some actors who are already rich and famous are cool about just making these horrible movies.

Permalink",8,17,5.0,"Now, I've been to some parties in my time, parties that have included fires on the roof of patios, blowing up a garden, chanting with the Hare Krishna, getting on the radio, bum fighting and defecating in inappropriate places. Witnessing one person recite the entire lyrics to LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"" whilst stepping over comatose revellers, people dancing naked on tables, drunkard piggy backs and beds being thrown from hotel windows! Some of which I have shamefully been planned or host to. So, is the Office Christmas Party an event I see actually happening? Partly yes. In fact, I found a lot of it clichéd and lame, taking all the usual craziness that occurs at office parties and tried to turn the volume up to eleven, like the writers have drawn from their own experiences or trawled through countless stories of other people's epic parties and amalgamating them all into one raving lunatic party. It's like the uncut version of the office party in Wolf Of Wall Street who's having to share office space with the Channel 4 news room. T.J. Miller is Clay, big kid, boss of a major hi-tech branch in Chicago only answerable to uber- bitch sister and CEO Carol, played by Jennifer Anniston, who wants to close his branch down unless he can close the deal of the century. Obviously, throwing the Christmas party of the century is the answer. He's not alone with departmental, straight-laced manager Josh (Jason Bateman) and tech- innovator and screen eye candy, Tracey (Olivia Munn) among a cast of stereotypical, office misfits. Bateman does his usual, laid back, unsurprised lead who looks more like he just wandered into the wrong movie. Munn is the stunning star here, though, like Bateman, seem too serious to suit the rest of the movie. I like the principles Clay strives for, a boss after my own heart, and Branson's too in a way, staff first, before customers and even share holders because of you look after the staff, you shouldn't have to worry about the customers. It's actually quite a true representation of how the corporate world of today has diminished morale and be profit focused. I get business is business, but they're lost something crucial along the way; valuing staff.The trailer is a little misleading with Kate McKinnon, those expecting the same quirky craziness she gave in this year's Ghostbusters might be disappointed but she's still very funny, embodying an entire HR department with a watchful eye. Maybe the trailer should have been a teaser, daring to tempt viewers instead of showing some of the key parts which unfortunately makes the film predictable and anticlimactic. As expected, it comes with a heavy soundtrack, dropping decent beats, especially the festive themed ""Deck Da Club"" from the Ying Yang Twins but it was disappointing to see Theodore Shapiro's name in the opening credits and not really hear his score. His work for Secret Life of Walter Mitty was one of my fave scores of 2013. It's funny, but not the funniest film of the year by a long shot. The trailer suggested more and I wanted more.

Miller) was given a New York branch. Sibling rivalry has Carol and Clay at odds. Carol sees the last quarter reports and wants to fire everyone, and no one get bonuses, and, of course, no Christmas party. She says that if someone can come up with an idea to bring in more money all will remain the same. No one can. Josh (Jason Bateman) is one of the company officers. Clay and Josh figure that if they can hire Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance) who can bring in millions, all will be saved. A Christmas party is born in spite of Carol and Walter Davis is to be invited to get him to join the company. I only took this out because I saw Jason Bateman's name. He is the only one in Hollywood who has the timing for whatever job he is hired for. Regardless of the movie he is in, watch him closely. The movie may be pure crap (as this one is), but he will shine. He knows timing. I would recommend that he set up a school to teach so-called-comedians of today how to do timing so they don't embarrass themselves as they do now. Okay, that said the first half of this movie is okay, some language, but nothing to point to shutting it down. However, when the party starts and seems to never end you will hear language to be sure, but you will see very crude and vulgar visuals with people, some naked, too. We know that Hollywood has sunk to lows they can never recover from and this movie proves that once again. In a word Hollywood knows nothing about how to do comedy as they are more interested in Shock Value because they think that is funny. Did I laugh at anything? Absolutely not. There was nothing funny or even clever. The title should have been Office Christmas Party from Hell.I will say that Bateman disappointed me (Bad Jason) doing a scene simulating a BJ on an ice sculpture that looks like Santa. Yes, the crowd put him up to it, but hey, it was in the script. The script needed a rewrite as soon as the party started. The rest of the time, he as Josh, was okay. Again, watch him. He knows timing. Jennifer Aniston as Carol was okay as a out-of-control CEO, but when she says FU to a little girl at an airport, I couldn't believe I heard that directed to a little girl. Her parents must be so proud she was in a movie, right?There is a twist later on, but who cares?

Permalink",6,21,,"""What I don't like about office Christmas parties is looking for a job the next day."" Phyllis DillerAlthough not all Christmas parties are a total disaster, the one in Office Christmas Party is only less so, with a destroyed office complex and a few relationships favorably grown. The film is goofy some of the time—we need to see a bare butt on the Xerox machine once, not several times—and rather touching at another—fighting brother and sister corporate heads come to understand each other's strengths. The survival of the tech company managed by Josh (Jason Bateman) depends on the finesse of branch owner, Clay (T.J. Miller), and the good will of his sister and acting CEO, Carol (Jennifer Aniston). Needless to say, the formula for the screwball comedy calls for disaster before redemption, and this party is no different. The first part before the party has some witty repartee, especially between Josh and his office mate and underling, Tracey (Olivia Munn). Included in the slightly witty category is Kate McKinnon's uptight HR head, Mary. What happens eventually to all the partiers you can easily guess, but along the way are some humor and some tender moments.After the silly shenanigans and sentimental chapters, Office Christmas Party emphasizes the collaborative and caring atmosphere necessary for any corporation to thrive.""The office Christmas Party is a great way to catch up with people you haven't seen for 30 minutes.""

Permalink",6,20,7.0,"""Office Christmas party"" (2016 release; 105 min.) brings the story of a ""non-denominational holiday mixer"" (thus coined by the HR manager) at the Chicago branch office of Zenodek Data Storage. As the movie opens, we see Josh signing his final divorce papers at his lawyer's office (where a super-boring office party is talking place). Upon returning to Zenodek, the company's CEO, Carol, arrives unannounced and threatens layoffs and the cancellation of the Christmas party. Now it's up to Josh and Clay to lead the charge for saving the office party (later that evening) and landing a new account that will secure the future for the Chicago branch office. At this point we're not even 15 min, into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from co-directors and producers Josh Gordon & Will Speck (best known for ""The Switch"" of a few years back). Here they bring again pair Jennifer Aniston (as Carole) and Jason Bateman (as Josh), and then for good measure add a cast of thousands. I'm exaggerating of course, but this movie's success stands or falls with the ensemble cast (more on that later). Yes, the movie has a plot, but that is not why we are watching this. We want to see ordinary people do crazy things, and in that sense the movie readily reminds me of ""Bad Moms"" earlier this year. Same angle, just a different story. After a while you're not even thinking about the story anymore. The jokes come at you fast and furious, including a riff on the Fast & Furious franchise (""they become more Fast, more Furious"", ha!), but also Price and Bowie, and a bunch of politically incorrect and/or crude stuff, some of which work, and others that fall flat Besides Aniston and Bateman, there's a bunch of others including from SNL: Kate McKinnon is hilarious are the uptight HR manager, Vanessa Bayer, T.J.Miller (as Clay), Rob Corddry, Olivia Munn, etc. etc. One of the Chicago Bulls has a cameo.

Permalink",3,8,5.0,"I guess this is one of those films where the poster caught my attention. Okay, while I know that one really shouldn't judged a movie by its poster, a part of me does like the type of movie about a party that goes completely out of control, much in the way that Bachelor Party did all those years ago. In a way it is pretty clear that Office Christmas Party is definitely going to be one of those films, and it sort of does remind me of my university days, especially the parties that we had at our house which basically resulted in us all staggering out of our bedrooms in the morning, looking at the mess that was scattered about, and going 'what the hell happened last night?'. Mind you, I can't actually say that we have ever had an office party turn up like this, but I guess one of the reasons that I stopped going to such events is because bad things always happen, and the office environment certainly isn't university.Anyway, the movie is set in Chicago, and the office environment is sort of going down hill big time ever since the founder died. The founder's son runs the Chicago branch, but his sister basically got the job as CEO, which is probably a good thing because the son is an incredibly laid back, happy go lucky sort of individual (and it is clear that he doesn't get on well with his sister). Anyway, in the modern corporate environment making a profit isn't good enough, so targets are lifted and non-essential spending is basically cut, which means that even the wine and cheese night has been canned. I should also mentioned that political correctness has also gone through the roof. However, there is an opportunity for the branch to meet it's target, and it involves courting a really important client, so they decide to throw caution to the wind and hold the mother of all Christmas parties.This movie is designed to offend, but then again all such movies fall into that category, and this is clear right from the get go when 'happy holidays' is plastered everywhere. I'm sure we all know the group of people that get incredibly offended at the term 'happy holidays', even though 'Seasons Greetings' has been around for much longer and nobody ever got offended at that. Mind you, these same groups of people also love to sprout out phrases like 'Jesus is the reason for the season' and 'let's put Christ back into Christmas', which I must admit has been going on for as long as I can remember, and the reality is that our modern western world really just uses the last couple of weeks in December to wind down and have a bit of fun.As for the corporate culture as it comes out in this film – well that seems to be very much the case as well, where cost cutting has become the norm, and the profit motive has ceased to come out of performance but out of how much a company can reduce expenditure. Of course a company needs to keep its expenditure in check, however there is also the question of company morale, and customers, especially important customers, aren't going to want to do business with a company that has an incredibly low morale.Anyway, the film itself was what you would expect from such a film, though I have to admit that the gratuitous nudity has got substantially worse since the 80s, but I guess that is to be expected. There are also the office stereo-types including the braniac who doesn't have a girlfriend but lies about it to make others think he is cool (when in reality they don't). You also the the grotniks that tend to go around causing trouble for everybody else, and then there is the cool boss who goes out of his way to look after his employees. I probably shouldn't forget to mention that we also have one of those parties that ends up going way out of control, and the climax, I have to admit, is pretty good (particularly with the throne that happens to be sitting in the office).As for a movie it is okay, though pretty mind numbing.

Permalink",5,16,6.0,"I found myself enjoying 'Office Christmas Party' perhaps more than I expected to. I expected more of a 'Project X' type film, simply with a higher budget and more accomplished cast. Instead, the film uses the party as a plot piece and relies more on character interactions around that. There is still a raucous party going on, and some scenes that would fit right in in 'Project X', but there is also more to it than that. That's not to say that there's a lot of emotional depth or any particularly original or enlightening story lines, but there is enough going on to keep the 105 minute run time ticking along. Some of the actors absolutely nailed their roles, while others sadly fell flat. A breakdown of some of the main cast:Jason Bateman: The man can play the straight guy well, but he relies heavily on having some quality performances from the actors he's interacting with. That's why he was so good in 'Horrible Bosses'. Here he mostly interacts with T.J. Miller, who falls flat a lot of the time, and thus Bateman's performance comes across a little off.T.J. Miller: Has the occasional funny line, but for the most part his timing is off and he can't create much with improvisation. It's a shame too because he probably has the most screen time of the entire cast. I would have loved to see a Will Ferrell type in this role.Jennifer Aniston: Not at her best here. It felt like she was just making an appearance so they could put her name in the credits to sell tickets. Unlike in 'Horrible Bosses', where she is given a chance to shine, here her character is bland and completely uninteresting.Kate McKinnon: She impressed me. I'm not particularly familiar with her work, other than having seen her play Hillary Clinton on 'Saturday Night Live'. She managed to get a lot of humour out of some poorly written lines at times though. She was a nice touch to the film.Rob Corddry: Usually one of my favourites in any movie he's in, but not here. Here he fell completely flat. I remember in 'Hot Tub Time Machine' thinking to myself that literally every line he spoke had me in fits. Here I don't think I laughed at a single line of his. Either poor writing or he just couldn't find his character. Either way, very disappointing.The stand out performance of the film though...Fortune Feimster: She only has a couple of scenes as an Uber driver, but they are absolutely hilarious. A brilliant cameo that picks the film up at a time it desperately needed it. Very impressive.The rest of cast didn't do enough of note to justify a review. Overall I'd call 'Office Christmas Party' a flawed film that is able to be enjoyed if you choose to. Some jokes fall flat, some are hilarious. Some of the story arcs are completely forgettable, others are reasonably well done. It's all very much hit and miss. It's not ""must-see"" by any means but it's certainly a harmless way to spend your time.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,8,5.0,"The title itself a short and sweet synopsis. What happens in the film is a chaos during partying and with the crazy twist and turns, the story head for the conclusion. There's no any difference comparing it with other Christmas party films you had seen. Just the cast and scenario changed, that's all. While the setback for his company branch, the head of the office decides not to compromise on the Christmas celebration thrown to his employees. At the same time, he has to pursue a big client who could save the office from closedown. So his intention turns to impress him at all the cost.Seasonal films like this should be watched when it comes out, which is during the Christmas/December. Because it will achieve a better result with us since we're set for the mood. I missed it then, but watched off the season and even though, I quite enjoyed it. Yeah, this film is not any good, yet nothing stopped me from having some fun. The comedies are cliché, but the actors were good. Fast paced narration, over hundred minutes long. Shot most of the film in a building, there's a little outdoor adventure. Overall, worth a watch, even though a below average film.5/10",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",5,14,5.0,"In a previous review (for NOCTURNAL ANIMALS) I seriously stated that I need to break into discussion groups to dissect and unpack the denseness that was that movie.No such problem exists with the raucous comedy Office Christmas Party, a free-wheeling, no holds barred wild comedy.Or so the producers would want you to believe.Starring Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, Office Christmas Party tells the tale of one last blow-out ""old-fashioned"" Office Christmas Party thrown by the head of a branch of a company (TJ Miller) who just received news that his branch is closing.  He promises a wild party complete with booze, booze and more booze.  Can photocopying your butt and copulating in the offices be far behind?Unfortunately, this Office Party is not nearly as raucous - or funny - as we were led to believe.Directed by Josh Gordon and Cliff Speck (two directors is always a bad sign, unless your name is Coen), Office Christmas Party is just, really, a series of scenes strung together to form a comedy.  Some of the scenes are mildly funny, the rest are quick enough to be done with, but strung together they just don't amount to much.A movie such as this relies heavily on the comedic chops of the cast - and a strong cast was put together, but even they couldn't salvage this thing.  Jason Bateman is capable - as always - as the feet on the ground center of this film.  Jennifer Aniston does a fine job as the chief antagonist and Olivia Munn is decent as the brains in the office who just might have a wild idea that could save the company.Did you notice I didn't really heap praise on these folks - good enough just isn't enough to overcome the lame antics of TJ Miller the ""wild guy"" in this film.  Movies of this sort need a fun ""wild guy"" that puts things over the top.  Think Zach Galifinakis in THE HANGOVER films or even Bill Murray in CADDYSHACK or (especially) John Belushi in ANIMAL HOUSE - those actors really brought something extra to their films and really pushed them over the top.  Miller, for me, is the hemorrhoid of comedy.  Something annoying that I just can't seem to get rid of.  I needed something special to overcome his performance and I just didn't get it.The only bright spot in this film is the usually terrific work of Kate McKinnon as the uptight, cheese eating, flatulence-prone HR director who's rules are being violated at every turn.  SOMEONE GET THIS PERSON HER OWN MOVIE!And you can skip this Office Christmas Party, you'll feel better about yourself in the morning, if you do.5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",5,14,,"There seems to be an annual tradition that, every holiday season, a studio will release a big Christmas comedy, usually with an ensemble cast, in the hopes of producing a new holiday cult classic that will catch on in the way that comedies like National Lampoon's Vacation or Bad Santa have over the years. Office Christmas Party, coming from directing duo Josh Gordon and Will Speck, strives for that same goal, while aiming to capture a mix festive silliness and R-rated raunchiness. The end result, despite being funny and enjoyable enough, is unlikely to become anyone's new favorite holiday movie.Judging by the marketing materials, the big draw of Office Christmas Party is its massive cast with big names Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston supposedly being the two stars. In reality, Aniston's role is relatively small. She's in the film's most important scenes, no doubt, but she's absent for a large portion of the story. Meanwhile, Bateman's performance, while solid and definitely meatier than Aniston's, is secondary to T.J. Miller. In terms of both overall screen time and importance to the story, Miller is undoubtedly the star of Office Christmas Party. Those who love Miller's presence on ""Silicon Valley"" like I do are bound to find plenty laugh at here, while those who find the actor annoying are likely to find themselves wishing that the movie focused more on Bateman and Aniston's characters. Miller does his best in trying to infuse a somewhat poorly written character with a level of sympathy and likability, but ultimately his character is a joke machine, offering up some great lines when the film needs them the most.If anything enhances Office Christmas Party from just being a watchable but forgettable holiday romp, it's the strong supporting cast. Olivia Munn, Kate McKinnon, Courtney B. Vance, Vanessa Bayer, Jillian Bell, and Randall Park do an incredible amount of heavy lifting, keeping the movie afloat with enough fun energy and pleasant moments to keep the audience from thinking about the thin plot and instances of implausibility. However, the highlight of the whole film is definitely Rob Cordrry. I've seen some reviews say that it's obvious Corrdry is phoning it in here in what is clearly a paycheck role, though whether that's true or not, Corrdry is by far the most memorable in the cast. Whenever Corrdry is on screen, Office Christmas Party is elevated almost 100% by his presence. He has the most memorable lines, gets the best reaction shots, and delivers in every scene. His joke about The Human Centipede had me laughing out loud for almost a whole minute.Mostly due to Corrdry's role, Office Christmas Party works well enough as a harmless, brainless Christmas comedy a majority of the time, but it's also not without its fair share of massive problems along the way. The film suffers from a lot of the same flaws that often plague big studio comedies these days, including an overabundance of unfunny genitalia jokes, an overly long running time, and a third act that barely works. There's also a fairly drawn out cameo by Jimmy Butler that brings absolutely nothing to the movie, and almost grinds the pacing to a screeching halt. I don't follow sports that closely, so maybe there's something supposedly funny or purposeful that I'm missing in having Jimmy Butler in the scene, but it never feels like anything other than the directors throwing in a celebrity cameo for the mere sake of having a celebrity cameo.There's plenty to criticize about Office Christmas Party, and indeed I've probably been harsher on the film than most people will be, though it's by no means a bad film. There are enough good jokes and a game cast to make it worthy of at least one viewing, and it's very likely to have be quite re-watchable given the sheer number of jokes that the film throws out. Those looking for a fun Christmas comedy could do a lot worse. Slightly recommended. 6/10",Warning: Spoilers,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

So, her brother, Clay, and his compadres throw a Christmas party against Carol's wishes in order to impress this guy whom they are trying to sign to a contract.So they through a huge party at the office, hundreds that aren't even employees show up, and some how Clay is taken by this lady pimp.

And now that I just read a couple pages of reviews I realize once again that there are a whole lot of humorless people walking on this planet.

Probably nothing. There are a lot of people that just never laugh, never have any fun in their pretty boring lives. I'm so lucky my wife has the same sense of humor as me, so that we have fun every day of the year. The story in the movie is not to be taken serious because it's just a comedy. Maybe with some stupid humor but it's still way better then a lot of other comedies. Kate McKinnon made me laugh the most, but the other comedians all added their bit as well to make it an enjoyable comedy to watch.

Which is not to say that all scripts require a strong ground or glue, merely that the more outrageous scripts, the scripts with the least internal cohesion, require as much ground as they can get.Which brings us to OFFICE XMAS PARTY, one of the more blatant examples of a ""spaghetti on the wall"" script. In other words, not a lot of fine tuning was done to get this baby ready for shooting day. The writers just took every gag they could think of, threw it against the wall, and then waited to see what stuck.Some of it stuck, most did not.But Bateman and Munn hold the film together by holding the attention of the viewer. In fact, they are so effortless at it that, every now and then, for just a split second, you almost think they are acting in another movie entirely, a romcom in which they are the only characters, and you are imagining the other 400 extras in this overdone extravaganza.Is it funny?

Permalink",27,44,7.0,"It is a few days to Christmas but you wouldn't really know it at the Chicago branch of Zenotec. Due to political correctness and the overzealousness of HR, there is very little in the way of celebrations. A quiet get-together is arranged but this is cancelled when the uptight, money-is-everything CEO (who happens to be the branch manager's sister) puts the kibosh on it. She also intends to retrench 40% of the staff at the branch. In a last ditch attempt to save the staff their jobs, the branch manager tries to land a major client. In order to show the client that they're not cold and uncaring, he (without his sister knowing) throws a huge Christmas party, and invites the client. Things could get rather festive, as long as HR don't have anything to do with it...Funny and fun. I had low expectations for this movie. It looked a lot like the silly sort of thing that Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and/or James Franco would appear in. The fact that it starred Jason Bateman (and not Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill or James Franco) gave me some hope and from the beginning, the hope was vindicated.Turns out the humour is quite irreverent and non-PC, even anti-PC, (just the way I like it) and reasonably clever in that regard. Definitely not a movie for the easily offended, especially find-an-offense types (even more reason to like it).It does get a bit predictable and silly towards the end but the first act was excellent and if that sort of quality had been maintained this could have been a classic comedy.Good for a laugh, plus for pointing out how stupid companies (and individuals) have gotten in their aversion to Christmas celebrations.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",120,276,1.0,"If you skip one Xmas party this year then make it Office Christmas Party.A criminally unfunny and underdeveloped high concept comedy, trying to recapture that Hangover like tone, Blades of Glory directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck fail to ignite the spirit of Xmas with this comedy caper that brings the festive vibe, but fails to bring the laughs.Like receiving a lump of coal in your Xmas stocking, Party offers up an interesting proposition but delivers nothing but disappointment, as a talented cast are laboured with material that should've been left in Santa's screen writing workshop as the appealing idea of a wild office party complete with outlandish shenanigans is instead overrun by a totally unappealing story of a struggling company trying to win a big contract, with added bi-polar pimps, sister/brother in-fighting and misuses of the office 3-D printer instead taking over.It's like you're constantly waiting for the true laughs to kick in as a rather labour intensive lead up to the party hitting full swing seems to drag on for far too long then once the party actually starts we are taken away on a consistent basis to revert back to one of the films countless other side stories, it's almost as if Gordon and Speck didn't trust their core concept enough and in the end failed to even unlock any of its potential to be a festive themed riot.Making matters worse for the film's tired scripting and plotting is a collection of equally tired performances from a well renowned cast.Lead by the ever the same Jason Bateman (looking and acting like he couldn't care less), Party wastes the comedic talents of T.J Miller (who seems better suited to cameo like turns rather than high screen time), Jennifer Anniston, Rob Cordry and worst of all Kate McKinnon while Olivia Munn just feels out of place in the whole wild night. The cast clearly had chances to improvise a large portion of the films dialogue and situations but barely any of the films payoffs actually work and at the end of the day most of the material here is below the performers talents.Looking to strike that cord between festive joy and raunchy comedy gold, Office Christmas Party ends up failing to find a winning balance in either denominator and with a collection of recycled jokes and confused stars, this is the worst kind of party where no one seems to be having fun other than the ones that organised the whole shebang.½ a Kia out of 5",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

It thinks it's a wild and crazy comedy, and oh boy, is it not. It plays it safe on nearly everything. It's as if Kate McKinnon's ultra-sensitive HR character directed the film. For a such a diverse cast of funny men and women, they are neutered of good material to work with. Jason Bateman is given nothing. Jennifer Aniston's character is one-note, though I'll give her credit for at least trying to make it work. Then, there's T.J. Miller. Dane Cook lite. He's currently being groomed as Hollywood's next hottest comedy star, and if he is, welcome to the dark ages. He is woefully unfunny. How did he make it out there? Why is it that so many amazing comedians, screenwriters and directors get turned down straight out of film school, and yet they give this man a shot? He gets the most screen time out of everyone here. It's quite sad actually. There are good performances in this, believe it or not. Kate McKinnon and the always funny Rob Corddry are the only two shining spots in this otherwise terrible film. I could go on, but why bother?

Permalink",40,87,4.0,"December always brings with it a raft of Yuletide yarns that are often fun but not overly great. This crude comedy continues that trend with an enjoyable yet completely disposable romp about the epic eponymous work shindig. When laidback office head Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is warned his Chicago department (inherited from Daddy) is going to be closed down unless he can secure a big contract, his solution is to throw an expensive party with live animals, lots of booze and the promise of bonuses. Of course the proverbial hits the fan and everything that can go wrong, does. Think The Hangover: Xmas Edition where we actually witnessed the night unfold before seeing everyone wake up with killer headaches and life lessons learnt. The gags fly at a million miles an hour with some sticking and some not, but it coasts by on it's super light mood and the sense that this group of extremely funny people are just having a blast hanging out on set and cracking jokes. Miller's man-child and Kate McKinnon's HR by-the-book weirdo are the standouts, and Jason Bateman's and Olivia Munn's more sensible employees are fine (although lacking chemistry as love interests), however Jennifer Aniston and Rob Corrdry are total misfires which bore throughout. The film also dovetails quickly when it gives a pimp subplot way too much attention, and the save-the-internet finale is dumb even by a popcorn comedy's standards, although the eclectic Christmas-themed soundtrack is surprisingly good. The epitome of a throwaway movie, Office Christmas Party maintains a certain level of enjoyment with its breezy vibe and the occasional laugh-out-loud gag, but is ultimately forgettable.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Unless you're a partying frat boy who spends most of his time on some kind of substance, you should stay very far away from Office Christmas Party. As I am not a partying frat boy, you might be wondering why I watched this terrible movie. I was suckered in by the ridiculous weakness of forcing myself to watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world. I thought, since she and Jason Bateman received top billing, it was going to be a Christmas edition of the Horrible Bosses films, which I did find funny. It had nothing to do with those movies; it just happened to take place in an office. Remember that group of boys in college who made student films over the weekend when they were drunk or high, and on Monday when they'd show their creation in class there would be the silence of crickets except for the creators themselves? They'd be giggling hysterically in the corner, remembering how funny their jokes and pratfalls had been at the time. And for some reason, they didn't understand or care that no one else thought their movie was funny, so they went out and did it again the next weekend. Office Christmas Party is a feature-length version of those terrible college videos. More than half the movie takes place at the party itself, and everyone drinks and does drugs to excess. The ""shenanigans"" the cast performs isn't at all funny to a sober audience who wasn't there at the time of the filming. Much as it breaks my heart, I'm forced to believe everyone involved in this movie has very bad taste.Unless you want to see the voice of Mr. Mucinex in his natural human form, I can't imagine any other legitimate reason for wanting to watch this movie. And I urge you to restrain yourself and content yourself with the preview.

Permalink",6,13,5.0,"Many people will admit to doing embarrassing things at an office Christmas party, so it is the perfect subject for a deliberately over-the-top festive comedy film, and it makes sense to have an ensemble cast, directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck (Blades of Glory, The Switch). Basically, Zenotek is a cut-throat technology firm, the Chicago branch's Chief Technical Officer, Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), is finalising his divorce. The company has failed to meet its quarterly quota, and interim CEO Carol Vanstone (Jennifer Aniston) is threatening to lay off staff, cut bonuses, cancel the annual Christmas party, and perhaps even shut down the branch. Her brother, branch manager Clay (T.J. Miller), is desperate to keep his staff. Josh and Clay, along with head of tech, Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn), propose partnering with financial giant Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance), to save the struggling company. Walter is pleased with the pitch, but concerned with another recent branch closure at Zenotek, and feels the company is more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to their Christmas party in hopes of showing him that their company is in good standing. Before leaving town, Carol offers Josh a position at her New York headquarters to which he declines. Clay funds a highly excessive Christmas party, much to the annoyance of Mary (Kate McKinnon), the head of Human Resources. Joel (Sam Richardson) is the evening's DJ, but the party struggles to pick up even with Tracey inviting Chicago Bulls player Jimmy Butler as a friend. Throughout the party, various employees cut loose: Nate (Karan Soni) tries to impress his colleagues Tim (Andrew Leeds) and Drew (Oliver Cooper) by hiring an escort named Savannah (Abbey Lee) to pretend to be his girlfriend; Clay's assistant and single-mom Allison (Vanessa Bayer) attempts to hook up with new hire Fred (Randall Park); and customer service supervisor Jeremy (Rob Corddry) cuts loose on the dance floor with Mary, whom he previously despised. Josh and Tracey get stuck on the roof and nearly kiss before Jeremy interrupts them. While initially reluctant, Walter is inadvertently doused with cocaine when it is accidentally fed into a snow machine and succumbs to his free-spirited nature. Clay wins over Walter's business, and the celebration gradually grows more chaotic as employees begin partaking in orgies, damaging company property, and doing drugs. Carol's flight is cancelled due to weather, and she rushes back to the office when she hears about the party from an Uber driver, who took people to the party. Though Carol is initially impressed with receiving Walter's business, Walter injures himself attempting to swing off a balcony after a conversation with Clay, and is later discovered to have been fired from his firm after his sudden business closure, making the proposed contract meaningless and leaving Zenotek helpless. Carol decides then and there to shut down the branch. She also reminds Josh about the job offer aloud to everyone, especially Clay, although he didn't accept it, the surrounding employees angrily shun him. Clay leaves to find another party and rushes off with Savannah's emotionally unstable pimp, Trina (Jillian Bell), who is more interested in robbing Clay of his wealth that he is actually keeping on his person. Josh, Tracey, Mary, and Carol race off to save Clay. One of the guests learns that the branch is being terminated and convinces everyone to throw out and destroy all the company equipment and burn everything in sight, forcing security guard Carla (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) to stop the unruly, now destructive and rebellious party. Clay with Trina's group and Josh with his group end up in a car chase together, and a near attempt at a jump over an open bridge gap. Both end up crashing into each other and causing a power outage across the entire city. Trina and Savannah are arrested for their crimes, while Clay is taken to the hospital. In the wake of the internet blackout, Tracey realises how to run a new innovation she's been working on for several years that combines internet Wi-Fi with wired connections through the city's power grid, which had previously failed due to real-world interference of the existing internet signals. They race back to the destroyed office to set up her tech, and when it works, internet is restored to Chicago. This new innovation saves the jobs of the entire team, with Clay apologising for how his father treated Carol. Walter, in the same hospital as Clay, agrees to join the team, while Josh and Tracey kiss share a kiss in the ruins of their office. Jeremy opens up to Mary, and Nate and Allison agree to go on a date. The whole group meets Carol and Clay as he's released from the hospital, and they all go out for breakfast, driving recklessly on the way. Also starring Jamie Chung as Meghan, Chloe Wepper as Kelsey, Matt Walsh as Ezra, Ben Falcone as Doctor, Fortune Feimster as Lonny and Michael Tourek as Alexei. Bateman, Aniston, Miller, McKinnon, Corddry and the other recognisable stars all play their parts, there is not very much in the way of a story or plot, but it doesn't matter, it is all about the chaotic behaviour as the staff get drunk and high, engaging in embarrassing and humiliating behaviour, there is even the traditional photocopying of body parts, it is likeable enough, a reasonably funny seasonal comedy.

Permalink",19,46,4.0,"Remind me never to go to an office Christmas party – or any office party for that matter. I'm just not willing to risk it. If the examples that appear on the big screen are any indication, these events are, at best, strange – or, at worst, downright scary. In 1988, ""Die Hard"" showed us a Christmas party that was taken over by terrorists! 2016's aptly named ""Office Christmas Party"" (R, 1:45) features people jousting with Christmas trees, heavy objects falling from tall buildings, people trying to jump tall bridges with their cars, pimps with guns – and party guests getting hospitalized! No, I don't ever want to go to any office Christmas parties, and if you're smart, given these cinematic cautionary tales, you shouldn't either. But should you go to the movie ""Office Christmas Party""? Well, that is the question now, isn't it? Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is in trouble. He's the manager of the original branch of national technology company Zenotech, but his branch is struggling to pull its weight and his joyless and mean-spirited sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), the CEO of Zenotech (since Clay and Carol's father died) is threatening to close down the branch – or at least put a big lump of coal in the stockings of many of its employees. Clay, along with Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), his Chief Technical Officer and best friend, tries to figure out a way to save the branch. Josh's assistant, Tracey (Olivia Munn), thinks she has an innovation idea that could do the trick, but Josh thinks that her idea isn't ready to demonstrate. Instead, the three of them focus on the strategy of winning the business of prospective client Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance).Clay, Josh and Tracey decide to show Walter that they are the kind of people he wants to deal with, by inviting him to their office Christmas party – and making it the funnest office party ever. As they're about the business of pulling together the party of the century in five hours and making it into the most fun their colleagues have ever had with their clothes on (for those who keep them on, that is), several of the people of Zenotech have their own individual struggles to deal with. Besides their business rivalry, there's a deep-seated sibling rivalry between Clay and Carol. Josh is newly divorced and is starting to make eyes at Tracey. Meanwhile, a nerdy employee named Nate (Karan Soni) keeps talking about a girlfriend whom others believe he has made up, while an employee named Allison (Vanessa Bayer) and another named Fred (Randall Park) are flirting with each other and a human resources representative named Mary Winetoss (Kate McKinnon) is zealously monitoring the behavior of all her co-workers.This movie is a semi-enjoyable, but semi-lazy holiday comedy. The story can be described as a mash-up of ""Unfinished Business"" (2015), ""Project X"" (2012), ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011), ""Billy Madison"" (1995) and ""Die Hard"". The basic plot is reasonably creative, but the script is mostly uninspired, unrealistic and predictable and the directing lacks energy. The comedy comes from a combination of juvenile hijinks, sexual humor, politically incorrect satire, wild sight gags and slapstick. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, but too much of the humor is uninspired and unfunny. Most of the cast members are not very effective, with the notable exception of McKinnon (showing off another version of her uptight-slash-odd comic persona), while Miller and Bateman hold their own, as do Jillian Bell (playing that aforementioned gun-toting pimp) and Da'Vine Joy Randolph (as a pleasant but tough security guard). The cast also includes a fair number of little known and unknown comic actors who show potential. If you get invited to ""Office Christmas Party"" by a friend and you don't expect too much, you may well have some fun, but this is one party that you probably shouldn't reshuffle your plans in order to attend.

Yes, it's another raunchy American comedy about partying hard and finding your inner cool, starring Jason Bateman doing his regular Bateman (warm humble regular joe who just wants to play it straight), Jennifer Aniston doing her regular 2010's comedy Jennifer Aniston (ice queen who turns out to be pretty awesome after all), and bunch of whats-his/her-names you are sure you remember from other movies somewhere.It's a very by-the-numbers comedy offering nothing that you have not seen too many times before. But the package's tight, so it works fine, especially on the big screen. Two notes of interest: the two most memorable characters here are both women, a pimp and an Uber driver.

Permalink",18,44,4.0,"The office Christmas party. An annual event that we've all been to and one that may lead to you seeing your colleagues in a new light, the quiet one may let their inner party animal out or the stingy boss may be the one buying everyone a drink at the bar. This comedy, aptly titled Office Christmas Party, dials up the debauchery to eleven with a talented comedic cast, and the results are very mixed to say the least.Clay Vanstone (T. J. Miller) is the Chicago branch manager for Zenotek, an IT sales company that's leaking money at an alarming rate. When his sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), who is also the CEO of Zenotek, shows up and threatens to shut the Chicago branch down, Clay must think of a way to convince Carol to change her mind.With the help of his friends Josh (Jason Bateman) and Tracey (Olivia Munn), Clay decides to throw an epic Christmas party for his employees to attract a big money client to become a partner. It isn't long before things get out of hand and with hardly any responsible adults in sight, the Chicago branch may be shutting itself down.The biggest frustration for me while watching Office Christmas Party was just how utterly wasted each and every one of this talented cast is by such a mediocre script and uninspired story. At this stage in their careers, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, who are both very good comedic actors, are sleepwalking their way through material like this for a simple pay day. The best comedic performances are given by T. J. Miller and Kate McKinnon however, even they are both let down by a lack of quality material. It's an unfortunate trait in comedies nowadays that they either seem like they don't put any effort in or they try way too hard.It's a strange mix of both in Office Christmas Party that makes it suffer. Don't get me wrong, I definitely laughed at some parts but for the most part, this film was just trying to raise a few cheap laughs from the audience.A disappointing experience overall, Office Christmas Party is one film you shouldn't try to emulate in real life, unless you want to get fired from your job. I mean, I'm pretty sure I'll never attend a Christmas party where a man dressed as Jesus is riding through the office on a white horse.",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",5,14,,"Office Christmas Party (2016) ** 1/2 (out of 4)When a jerk of a CEO (Jennifer Aniston) threatens to shut down her brother's (Clay Vanstone) compnay, he and Josh (Jason Bateman) try to score one big deal to save it. The only problem is that it doesn't go as planned so they propose to have a massive Christmas party to show the person how great their company can be.OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY is pretty much what you'd expect from a recent Jason Bateman film. The screenplay is certainly under developed but at the same time the film really isn't trying to be anything other than an offensive and funny comedy. For the most part I'd say about forty percent of the jokes worked so the film is okay and worth sitting through as long as you aren't expecting some sort of masterpiece.As I said, not every joke works but I do think enough of them did to make the film worth sitting through. Once the party gets started we obviously get a lot of drunken humor with people doing very stupid things for jokes. Some of the funniest moments involve Courtney B. Vance who plays the man that the leads are trying to impress. I won't say what happens to him but Vance is quite funny here. I also thought Miller was quite good in his role and both Bateman and Olivia Munn are good for what they're asked to do. Aniston plays pretty much the same type of character she did in HORRIBLE BOSSES but she was at least fun to watch.The story here is pretty weak and especially a third act where our lead is taken hostage by a hooker and her pimp. The finale is also pretty stupid but as I said the screenplay really wasn't developed too well.

Permalink",7,20,8.0,"'OFFICE Christmas PARTY': Four Stars (Out of Five)A Christmas comedy film about a group of desperate employees, that are trying to save their company's branch (from being closed) by throwing an awesome office Christmas party (to attract a potential big client). It was directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon; and it was written by Justin Malen, Laura Solon, Dan Mazer, Jon Lucas, Scott Moore and Timothy Dowling. The film stars Jason Bateman, T.J. Miller, Olivia Munn, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney B. Vance, Kate McKinnan, Jillian Bell, Rob Corddry, Vanessa Bayer, Karan Soni and Randall Park (Bateman and Aniston also starred in Speck and Gordon's last movie 'THE SWITCH'). It received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has done well at the Box Office (so far). I enjoyed it.Clay Vanstone (Miller) is the branch manager of Zenotek's Chicago branch. His sister Carol (Aniston) is the company's intermediate CEO. She also resents Clay, because Clay was always their father's favorite (who recently passed away). Carol is threatening to make huge cuts, to the business, and possibly shut down Clay's branch; unless they can meet her new quarterly quota. One way, they could possibly do this, is by partnering with Walter Davis (Vance). Clay thinks the best way to impress him is to throw an awesome office Christmas party; which he, and his technical officers (Bateman and Munn), invite him to.The movie is pretty funny (in places) and the cast is all awesome in it (especially Miller). I wouldn't call it a Christmas classic though; only time will tell I guess, but I seriously doubt it. It is well made though, it has a great premise and it's very humorous (from time to time). None of the jokes are that bad either (and it's never painful to sit though), that's a big positive in my opinion.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GAMlEeVv1H0",,Office Christmas Party,Comedy,5.9,2016,0,105.0,87808,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711525/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",8,17,5.0,"Now, I've been to some parties in my time, parties that have included fires on the roof of patios, blowing up a garden, chanting with the Hare Krishna, getting on the radio, bum fighting and defecating in inappropriate places. Witnessing one person recite the entire lyrics to LL Cool J's ""I Need Love"" whilst stepping over comatose revellers, people dancing naked on tables, drunkard piggy backs and beds being thrown from hotel windows! Some of which I have shamefully been planned or host to. So, is the Office Christmas Party an event I see actually happening? Partly yes. In fact, I found a lot of it clichéd and lame, taking all the usual craziness that occurs at office parties and tried to turn the volume up to eleven, like the writers have drawn from their own experiences or trawled through countless stories of other people's epic parties and amalgamating them all into one raving lunatic party. It's like the uncut version of the office party in Wolf Of Wall Street who's having to share office space with the Channel 4 news room. T.J. Miller is Clay, big kid, boss of a major hi-tech branch in Chicago only answerable to uber- bitch sister and CEO Carol, played by Jennifer Anniston, who wants to close his branch down unless he can close the deal of the century. Obviously, throwing the Christmas party of the century is the answer. He's not alone with departmental, straight-laced manager Josh (Jason Bateman) and tech- innovator and screen eye candy, Tracey (Olivia Munn) among a cast of stereotypical, office misfits. Bateman does his usual, laid back, unsurprised lead who looks more like he just wandered into the wrong movie. Munn is the stunning star here, though, like Bateman, seem too serious to suit the rest of the movie. I like the principles Clay strives for, a boss after my own heart, and Branson's too in a way, staff first, before customers and even share holders because of you look after the staff, you shouldn't have to worry about the customers. It's actually quite a true representation of how the corporate world of today has diminished morale and be profit focused. I get business is business, but they're lost something crucial along the way; valuing staff.The trailer is a little misleading with Kate McKinnon, those expecting the same quirky craziness she gave in this year's Ghostbusters might be disappointed but she's still very funny, embodying an entire HR department with a watchful eye. Maybe the trailer should have been a teaser, daring to tempt viewers instead of showing some of the key parts which unfortunately makes the film predictable and anticlimactic. As expected, it comes with a heavy soundtrack, dropping decent beats, especially the festive themed ""Deck Da Club"" from the Ying Yang Twins but it was disappointing to see Theodore Shapiro's name in the opening credits and not really hear his score. His work for Secret Life of Walter Mitty was one of my fave scores of 2013. It's funny, but not the funniest film of the year by a long shot. The trailer suggested more and I wanted more.

Permalink",11,28,2.0,"The owner of an I.T. company died, and that resulted in the daughter of the owner, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), as acting CEO and the son Clay (T.J. Miller) was given a New York branch. Sibling rivalry has Carol and Clay at odds. Carol sees the last quarter reports and wants to fire everyone, and no one get bonuses, and, of course, no Christmas party. She says that if someone can come up with an idea to bring in more money all will remain the same. No one can. Josh (Jason Bateman) is one of the company officers. Clay and Josh figure that if they can hire Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance) who can bring in millions, all will be saved. A Christmas party is born in spite of Carol and Walter Davis is to be invited to get him to join the company. I only took this out because I saw Jason Bateman's name. He is the only one in Hollywood who has the timing for whatever job he is hired for. Regardless of the movie he is in, watch him closely. The movie may be pure crap (as this one is), but he will shine. He knows timing. I would recommend that he set up a school to teach so-called-comedians of today how to do timing so they don't embarrass themselves as they do now. Okay, that said the first half of this movie is okay, some language, but nothing to point to shutting it down. However, when the party starts and seems to never end you will hear language to be sure, but you will see very crude and vulgar visuals with people, some naked, too. We know that Hollywood has sunk to lows they can never recover from and this movie proves that once again. In a word Hollywood knows nothing about how to do comedy as they are more interested in Shock Value because they think that is funny. Did I laugh at anything? Absolutely not. There was nothing funny or even clever. The title should have been Office Christmas Party from Hell.I will say that Bateman disappointed me (Bad Jason) doing a scene simulating a BJ on an ice sculpture that looks like Santa. Yes, the crowd put him up to it, but hey, it was in the script. The script needed a rewrite as soon as the party started. The rest of the time, he as Josh, was okay. Again, watch him. He knows timing. Jennifer Aniston as Carol was okay as a out-of-control CEO, but when she says FU to a little girl at an airport, I couldn't believe I heard that directed to a little girl.

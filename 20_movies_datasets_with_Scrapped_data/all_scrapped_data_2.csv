Permalink",31,36,,"I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. When it first came out the title threw me, I don't like seeing movies of families fighting. But I didn't understand, this is about a family where mom, dad, brother, and sister are all wrestlers.It is based on the true story of a real British family. Florence Pugh (who I found so good in the 2016 Lady Macbeth) plays the lead character, Saraya Knight, who longed to get a break and get into the WWE as a featured wrestler. When she gets the chance she finds out it is harder than she ever imagined, including leaving her home and family behind to train in the USA.All of the first half-hour and much of the remainder is in England, as such it contains much of the uniqueness of British characters, British humor, and British mannerisms. Viewers who don't appreciate that may not enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it very much. There is a very nice story here and the actors bring it to life very well.One of my favorite movies of 2019.Edit: I watched it again in March 2020, a really entertaining movie.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",14,15,7.0,"Siblings Saraya and Zac have been into wrestling for as long as they can remember. Born into a wrestling-mad family they now run a wrestling clinic for kids and take part in the regular wrestling shows and tournaments their parents produce. Their chance to hit the big time arrives when the WWE has auditions in the UK. Could this be their big break?Thanks to the trailer, I had very low expectations for this. The trailer made the film look very silly and low brow. I wouldn't have watched if it wasn't for a friend pointing out that the film is nothing like the trailer and is far better than it seems.Turns out they were right. Rather than lowest-common-denominator slapstick the plot is interesting and is complete with some great, clever humour and an engaging warmth. Moves at a good pace: the time just flies by.All this aided by some solid performances. Florence Pugh is great as Saraya and she is ably supported by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Jack Lowden as her family. Even Vince Vaughn, usually the kiss of death for any film or TV series, puts in a solid, engaging performance.All this coming from someone who is not into WWE or wrestling at all.On the negative side, it does end feeling like just another Rocky remake. Still, it was a funny and interesting journey getting there.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",26,30,7.0,"Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paige's story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you don't really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy ""Fighting with My Family"". It's a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. It's has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zak's prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once she's over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in ""Little Drummer Girl"" last year. It's Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paige's journey isn't perhaps that extraordinary. She's way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. It's not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.""Fighting with My Family"" is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I can't imagine it's going to be anybody's favourite film of all time, it's a lot of fun to watch and I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but there's a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",80,98,7.0,"Had to double take on the director and writer and make sure if it was THE Stephen Merchant writing and directing this film and it turned out it was so that was interesting. I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.The film tells the story of Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.Florence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.The film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film. Merchant does a good job.7/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

This movie is based on a true story about a female wrestler and her wrestling family. Florence plays Saraya Knight, aka Paige. Nick & Lena are her parents, who had a traveling wrestling show in England that they performed in. The whole family wrestled including her 2 brothers-one was in prison for most of the movie for getting into fights-and there were even matches with the parents verses the kids. Vince plays the talent scout for the WWE, aka World Wrestling Entertainment, and when he announces on tv that there will be a new talent cattle call and all newcomers are welcome, Florence and her brother-the one that is not in prison-go for a try out. The movie is written & directed by Stephen Merchant, an actor that has a cameo in the film. There are several wrestling cameos as well. I'm not up on my wrestlers like I used to be but I did recognize Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and John Cena, and yes, The Rock is pretty much a cameo role-he has a couple of scenes-not like the previews make you think.

Permalink",18,22,6.0,"This is a very British working class comedy which centres around a wrestling mad family and their dreams of stardom. Its based on a true story and roughly around a documentary of the family made recently. At the helm is one of the writers of The Office, the superior UK version not the US remake. Also on board are a few American actors and Nick Frost from Spaced.
The tone of the movie is something like the commitments or Full Monty, you may need to be British to get some of the humour. Fortunately not all movies are made with the states in mind.
It is very funny however some of the language and scenes of violence may not make it suitable for smaller kids.
Also I have no interest or knowledge of wrestling but that didnt detract from the enjoyment of the movie.
This is not a mega-bucks The Rock vehicle, its a low key small budget UK flick with no real surprises but a few laughs along the way.
Its quite enjoyable.
Also the last thing, the reviewer know as ""thebricks"" used the final section of his review to call the UK a dump and suggest the people here just drink and fight which is highly offensive to us in the UK.
The fact that despite it being flagged twice for being offensive and off topic shows the mods do not seem to care about xenophobia.

Permalink",4,4,7.0,"Written and directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is a fictional remake of a 2012 Channel 4 documentary of the same name. Without spoiling this unconventional funny heart breaking inspiration tale too much; the film about how Saraya Bevis (Florence Pugh) became wrestling superstar Paige was a bit jarring to watch with all the historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie simplified her pre WWE career to only working for her father's struggling promotion as always as Paige; when in truth, she work for many independents companies like Shimmer as Britani Knight. While I didn't mind that, I did think the movie could had shown that she was indeed unsuccessful in her first try out for WWE before getting the job later that same year. It would had add more to her comeback story and give hope to her brother Zak (Jack Lowden). Nevertheless, when she did signed her contract. She wasn't really assigned to NXT and its high tech performance center, but to then near dead developmental territory, FCW. It's here where she got the name Paige. Once again, I didn't really mind that, however the film kinda cop out by not showing any of her real cotemporaries. Don't get me wrong, I know that most of them are no longer in the company and that they can't use their likeness for the film. However, I really couldn't get with simpleton fictional character Jeri-Lynn (Kim Matula) when there is far more interesting and compelling side real-life individuals that they could had put into the film like Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch or Alexa Bliss. Just think of the stories, the movie could had with them. As for the lack of mention of her championships runs in NXT, it's alright as it build to her big win for the Divas belt from AJ Lee (Thea Trinidad) in the ending. However, that women championship is not that longstanding or well established as the film makes it out to be. In truth, it's a pretty pathetic title with a short heritage. So personally, the big win was not that interesting. While the movie did made the debut far more intense with fans jeering her and hard-hitting with actual match rather than a quick squash with audience already cheering. The fight was too clumsily put together. Plus, I kinda hate that Naomi and Tamina weren't there in the film to witness it. As for the performances. Trinidad was fine. She sound like AJ even if she didn't look like her due to Lee's trouble relationship with the company. As for producer Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson, he was fine, even if he somewhat hogged the spotlight. His presence in the film wasn't really needed. It was also nice to see cameos from other superstars even if they don't really look like that at the time. As for most of the quirkiest about Paige's family. It was well developed and delivered. Nick Frost and Lena Headey as the parents & the cameos of the real-life family members were fine even if her older half-sister didn't appear or mention in the film. However, Pugh as the lead role was a bit of a disappointment. Her acting was a bit off playing the wrestler a little too aversion. Not only that, but her appearance doesn't really match the real life Sayara. She is far too short and chubby. Also her wrestling skills were not really athletic. No wonder, why the filmmakers got Tessa Blachard to do most of the stunt work. Honestly, Tessa makes a more realistic Paige than Pugh. Better yet, why not have real-life Paige play herself. Nevertheless, the true star of the film has to go to Lowden as Zak. His dismissal sub plot about having to makes peace with himself, not making it to WWE was highly watchable & very compelling. However, unlike the real life guy who appearance and wrestling skills are average. This character had a pretty boy facial look, well tone body and amazing skills on the mat. So it doesn't make a lick of sense why he didn't get signed in the first place. At least, the original documentary show that Zak suffer from a knee injury preventing him from getting hired. As for Vince Vaughn as fictional composite trainer Hutch Morgan. He was fine. Yet, I just don't buy him as an ex-wrestler. I just wish, the movie establish more side coaches like Dusty Rhodes. It just seem odd for one man to be fully in charge of scouting, training and hiring for a global wrestling corporation without much help. Nevertheless, they did a good job of not featuring then head trainer Bill DeMott in this film, as he later resign amid accusations of abuse, misconduct and sexual harassment. That would be uncomfortable. However, it's a topic worth checking into the future. The same with showing the turbulent in her life since joining the company such as her drug suspended, her scandalous love, sex life being made public and her getting career ending injury. It would give the sequel if they make one, more depth as this movie felt a little simplified. Because of that, I felt like the film could end up being highly forgotten in the coming years like the Paige looking dishevel promo popular internet meme. This movie would get lose in the shuffle. In the end, while is Paige's house now. In a few years, it will be a house of cards. Nevertheless, this biopic has very good insight into how crazy professional wrestling really is. It offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes of WWE, and a rarer glimpse of what it takes just to get there. Even if some of the themes about overcoming adversity and hurdles has been done before in other scrappy underdog sport films. It's a step up from the other WWE Studios films. At least, we can be all on the same page about that.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",8,10,10.0,"Although Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson gets top billing in British writer & director Steven Merchants' amusing but insightful wrestling biography ""Fighting with My Family,"" he spends most of its 108 minutes off screen. In other words, if you're going to watch another of the Rock's conventional action thrillers, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Essentially, ""Fighting with My Family"" is the equivalent of a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), and Merchant chronicles the rise of a female British wrestler, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Outlaw King""), who had dreamed since age 13 about breaking into the WWE. In case you aren't familiar with the acronym, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., is what it means. Mind you, the WWE classifies their matches as dramatic because they amount to theatrical productions, with narrative-forged escapades orchestrated long before the talent tangle before multitudes. Approximately eight years ago, when Johnson was in the U.K., filming ""Fast & Furious 6,"" he saw a documentary about a Norwich-based family that held impromptu matches. He enjoyed it so much he contacted his ""Tooth Fairy"" co-star Steven Merchant about writing a screenplay about the Knight family's outrageous shenanigans. The patriarch of the Knight clan had wrestled professionally before he established a school for wrestlers that kept at-risk juveniles out of trouble.
As the title suggests, ""Fighting with My Family"" concerns a contentious, dysfunctional, working-class yarn about aspiring wrestlers. Nevertheless, this entertaining biopic isn't a generic, shallow account of the wrestling world that you'll forget once you've seen it. Indeed, this movie is all about female empowerment and the groundbreaking changes for women that Saraya Knight brought about as one of the youngest WWE Divas Champions. Merchant has created several sympathetic characters who experience change over time. Refusing to ridicule wrestling, Merchant has infused this factual story with as much blue-collar authenticity as if it had been made in the 196os, like the Albert Finney classic ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning."" The dialogue is literate; the performances endearing, and the humor is often subtle but never crude.
""Fighting with My Family"" concentrates on the exploits of our heroine, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Lady Macbeth""), who wasn't bitten by the wrestling bug until she turned thirteen and found herself substituting for an absent wrestler. Saraya's father, stout Ricky Knight (Nick Frost of ""Shawn of the Dead""), operates his own wrestling franchise in England. When Ricky isn't promoting tournaments, Ricky's second son Zak Knight (Jack Lowden of ""Dunkirk"") teaches at-risk adolescents, from public school to drop-outs, how to wrestle. Zak recruits all kinds, saving one teen from the misfortune of peddling contraband narcotics to lowlifes. Zak doesn't rate as much screen time as Saraya, but his impact on his sister's life is his prime contribution to the plot. Zak grew up watching the WWE. As a child, he could identify every wrestler strictly by their footwear. Obsessively, he had dreamed about wrestling in the WWE long before Saraya got converted. The WWE dispatches a gruff coach, Hutch (Vince Vaughn of ""Wedding Crashers""), to London in search of fresh blood. Saraya and Zak attend the audition with a carnival of other hopeful types in spandex. Tragically, Zak doesn't make the cut. Neither, for that matter, does anybody else, except his younger sister Saraya. Of course, she is stunned. Originally, she wanted to use the name Brittany, but the WWE already had a Brittany, so Saraya settles for Paige.
As Paige, Saraya dresses like a Goth girl: black apparel, black hair, with dark raccoon eyes. Later, during her first official bout, Paige encounters a defending champion who teases her appearance about her Halloween costume. Initially, Saraya refused to make the flight to train in Florida unless Zac came along, but Hutch refused to add her brother. Predictably, Hutch's decision crushes Zac. By all rights, Zac seemed like a shoo-in with his experience and demeanor. Over the ensuing 45 minutes, Zac struggles with the demise of his dream, momentarily careening off the rails himself in a bar fight until his older brother, Roy Knight (James Burrows of 2010's ""Robin Hood""), straightens him out. It seems Zak is a natural born teacher who inspires his students. Once Zak realizes his destiny lies with his family and the next generation of wrestlers that he can develop, he sheds his anxiety about his failure to make the WWE.
Meanwhile, Paige discovers training in sunny, faraway Florida is no picnic. She has to negotiate tough obstacle courses and flip over huge tractor tires to either shape up or ship out. At first, she alienates herself and dismisses a quartet of bimbo-like babes with golden California tans and statuesque figures. Paige's mother, Julia (Lena Headey of ""Dredd""), warns her daughter about such creatures who use their bodies to mesmerize audiences with their physical endowments. Paige dismisses them as if they were prostitutes, until she realizes that she has not only misjudged them but also herself. Hutch hovers over his recruits like a boot camp drill instructor. Constantly, he taunts them when they find the going desperate to take the easy way out and quit. Throughout these antics, Paige struggles to fit in with her cohorts, eventually dying her mane blond and spraying on a golden tan. Ultimately, it doesn't take long for our heroine to realize she cannot be somebody she isn't.
As Saraya's father Ricky, Nick Frost plays a supporting role in this cheeky comedy, but his presence makes an unforgettable impression. Wearing a shock of hair like a Mohawk Indian, Ricky is a motor-mouthed, down-to-earth, fellow. One of his best bits occurs when he auditions an aspiring wrestler who must withstand a direct blow to the face with a garbage can lid. Frost is contagiously hilarious, but he occasionally turns serious when Saraya isn't sure about her future in wrestling. The ensemble cast generates convincing charisma, and Saraya/Paige emerges triumphant despite her underdog status. ""Fighting with My Family"" qualifies as a memorable domestic melodrama as well as a first-rate wrestling masterpiece.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",39,60,8.0,"Another day, another chance to review a movie, and this morning's review is an interesting film that held much potential to be fun and unique. Sports movies seem to be the theme of this week, though this film certainly is not the typical approach to a typical sport that is portrayed in the film. Robbie K here to take a look at the British comedy about an American sports venue that continues to rake in the dough of Wrestling, and the hidden world that you might not know involved in the theatrical event. Let's get started as I take a look at:Movie: Fighting With My Family (2019)Director:
Stephen Merchant
Writer:
Stephen Merchant
Stars:
Dwayne Johnson, Lena Headey, Vince Vaughn
LIKES:Funny
Deeper Story
Training Montages
Casting
Good Utilization of Extras
Good Pace
UniqueSUMMARY:Fighting With My Family may not be the typical comedy given a lot of approaches with this movie, but my friend and I both did enjoy the comedy that was presented. It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements that I had not expected from the trailers. Character development, major themes of family, friendship, dedication, and many other subplots actually work well to provide an engaging film that isn't quite the norm for this genre. In addition, it reveals the hard work that goes into becoming a wrestler, and how physically/emotionally demanding the application process can be in something that many do not even pass a look at.
The cast certainly does the job of bringing the tale to life with Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden crushing their performances with characters that drive much of the movie, the former in particular being the central pillar to base everything around. Yet secondary characters played by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn are utilized so well that they not only avoid overshadowing, but really mesh well with the main performers. Even the tertiary characters have some good involvement in the film, showing that you can utilize the cast well and tell a very good story, even with a super celebrity in the mix. Needless to repeat, but will anyway, this film utilizes its actors very well, crafting a family component. And it is all done with a pace that is entertaining to watch, not being too caught up in the drama to be slow, and yet still going slow enough to tell much of the story. Certainly this is a unique concept, but also a unique example of how a movie can be done.DISLIKES:The Inclusion of the Extra brother
The Rapid Development of Character Relationships at Times
The Rapid Story jumps at times.
Dramatization Vs. Facts
Semi Predictable
SUMMARY:Finding dislikes for me was a little harder than I anticipated, but here are few parts of the story that were a little off my element. While the characters were done well, the extra brother that got brought in I don't think was utilized as well. Yes, he has his place, but compared to some of the other characters, his arc had some drama and potential, but then kind of fizzled out compared to what I thought they were going to do. In addition, the movie surprisingly made some good character relationships, but then progressed them a little too quickly. I was hoping that there would be a little more time with tending to the flourishing relationship they were starting to build. This is primarily during the wrestling training period where things go from zero to 100% in a relatively short amount of time, and while still good I wanted more development with them in terms of that story arc. And because of trying to fit the tale in the shorter amount of time, the movie, especially near the end led to some hasty jumps that just as things were starting to develop were quickly transitioned to the next phase. Again, I would have liked a little more fleshed out conclusions and integrations, but it certainly is not as short sheeted as some other films have done.
In regards to the dramatization, well it works to add that Hollywood magic to jazz up stories, but I do understand that those who know Paige's story might want more fact than fiction. I can't really say I know the story, but the movie works well to blend the structures with that Hollywood magic to make it entertaining. If you are fans of the story of the youngest Diva though, then brace yourself for some potential divergence. In regards to the rest of the tale, the semi predictable plot is something else difficult to ignore, though again, the rest of the movie sort of offsets this component so it's only a minor area of improvement.
The VERDICT:Surprisingly, the movie worked much better than what I was expecting from the trailers. It's balanced on many levels, telling an entertaining story, with multiple levels than the typical comedy brings to you. With great use of characters/actors, comedy that is a bit diversified, and a pace that brings the wrestling world to life, you have a fantastic film to get lost into. Yet, there are still a few other components still in need of more time than anything else, to take those components they were building and strengthen them further. I enjoyed this film a lot to warrant a trip to the theater, but can understand if you want to reserve your trips to the more special effect frenzy that other films have going for it. Definitely look for it at home though.My scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 8.5

Permalink",10,13,8.0,"I love movies that open my mind up to a world that I was not previously accustomed to. The world of professional wrestling has never once appealed to me. A staged ""sport"" where grown men in tights throw each other around to compete for a ""title belt""? Yeah, no, not for me. But if there's anything I've learned over years of seeing hundreds of movies in theaters, you have to keep your mind open. Fighting with My Family is not only a huge delight and surprise, but one that did slightly peak my interest in at least giving wrestling a shot. Anchored by the producing presence of The Rock and even acting in a few scenes, Stephen Merchant carefully crafts the story of a family of wrestlers who have dreams of making it big, only for one of their children to win a shot at the WWE over the other. Florence Pugh plays ""Paige"", the real life WWE Champion who worked her way up the WWE to become the youngest champion at age 21. Pugh, who was brilliant in The Outlaw King, gives Paige a snarky but extremely charming edge. There's no doubt in my mind, Pugh has the makings of a future Oscar winner.

Permalink",6,7,9.0,"I recently saw 'Ford v Ferrari' and hated every minute of it. I thought I hated every minute of it because I have a passionate dislike for motor racing. 'Fighting with My Family' is proof that that was not the case, because I also despise wrestling, yet loved this film. I couldn't believe how invested I found myself. I genuinely cared not just about the characters, but the wrestling outcome as well. If you'd told me I'd feel that way going into this movie I would've laughed in your face. Stephen Merchant is a genius.Back when Merchant and Ricky Gervais were working together Gervais was given the majority of the credit for their brilliant work. I have always maintained though that it was Merchant who was the true architect behind the brilliance, because what Gervais has achieved since Merchant left has been pitiful by comparison. Merchant's biggest strength is his structuring. He perfectly paces his films, gives every character the ideal amount of time to shine, and keeps the audience invested throughout. Then add in the fact that the man is hilarious and you have a perfect package. He is the most under-rated filmmaker working today.The cast in this movie is incredible too. Florence Pugh finishes off her almost perfect 2019. She is the glue that holds this film together. Vince Vaughan gets a role perfectly suited for him and nails it. I love it when he is given free reign to be as sarcastic as possible. He may just be the best in the business at that. Finally, Nick Frost is again in terrific form. He's hilarious and also immensely charming all at once. You can't help but love him.This movie is a comedy at its heart, but let me tell you it moved me a lot more than most out and out dramas manage to. Add to that how inspirational it is and you are left with an incredibly good film. I can't recommend this one highly enough.

When she gets the chance she finds out it is harder than she ever imagined, including leaving her home and family behind to train in the USA.All of the first half-hour and much of the remainder is in England, as such it contains much of the uniqueness of British characters, British humor, and British mannerisms.

Permalink",26,30,7.0,"Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paige's story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you don't really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy ""Fighting with My Family"". It's a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. It's has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zak's prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once she's over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in ""Little Drummer Girl"" last year. It's Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paige's journey isn't perhaps that extraordinary. She's way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. It's not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.""Fighting with My Family"" is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I can't imagine it's going to be anybody's favourite film of all time, it's a lot of fun to watch and I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but there's a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",80,98,7.0,"Had to double take on the director and writer and make sure if it was THE Stephen Merchant writing and directing this film and it turned out it was so that was interesting. I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.The film tells the story of Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.Florence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.The film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film.

This movie is based on a true story about a female wrestler and her wrestling family. Florence plays Saraya Knight, aka Paige. Nick & Lena are her parents, who had a traveling wrestling show in England that they performed in. The whole family wrestled including her 2 brothers-one was in prison for most of the movie for getting into fights-and there were even matches with the parents verses the kids. Vince plays the talent scout for the WWE, aka World Wrestling Entertainment, and when he announces on tv that there will be a new talent cattle call and all newcomers are welcome, Florence and her brother-the one that is not in prison-go for a try out.

Permalink",18,22,6.0,"This is a very British working class comedy which centres around a wrestling mad family and their dreams of stardom. Its based on a true story and roughly around a documentary of the family made recently. At the helm is one of the writers of The Office, the superior UK version not the US remake. Also on board are a few American actors and Nick Frost from Spaced.
The tone of the movie is something like the commitments or Full Monty, you may need to be British to get some of the humour. Fortunately not all movies are made with the states in mind.
It is very funny however some of the language and scenes of violence may not make it suitable for smaller kids.
Also I have no interest or knowledge of wrestling but that didnt detract from the enjoyment of the movie.
This is not a mega-bucks The Rock vehicle, its a low key small budget UK flick with no real surprises but a few laughs along the way.
Its quite enjoyable.
Also the last thing, the reviewer know as ""thebricks"" used the final section of his review to call the UK a dump and suggest the people here just drink and fight which is highly offensive to us in the UK.
The fact that despite it being flagged twice for being offensive and off topic shows the mods do not seem to care about xenophobia.

Permalink",4,4,7.0,"Written and directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is a fictional remake of a 2012 Channel 4 documentary of the same name. Without spoiling this unconventional funny heart breaking inspiration tale too much; the film about how Saraya Bevis (Florence Pugh) became wrestling superstar Paige was a bit jarring to watch with all the historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie simplified her pre WWE career to only working for her father's struggling promotion as always as Paige; when in truth, she work for many independents companies like Shimmer as Britani Knight. While I didn't mind that, I did think the movie could had shown that she was indeed unsuccessful in her first try out for WWE before getting the job later that same year. It would had add more to her comeback story and give hope to her brother Zak (Jack Lowden). Nevertheless, when she did signed her contract. She wasn't really assigned to NXT and its high tech performance center, but to then near dead developmental territory, FCW. It's here where she got the name Paige. Once again, I didn't really mind that, however the film kinda cop out by not showing any of her real cotemporaries. Don't get me wrong, I know that most of them are no longer in the company and that they can't use their likeness for the film. However, I really couldn't get with simpleton fictional character Jeri-Lynn (Kim Matula) when there is far more interesting and compelling side real-life individuals that they could had put into the film like Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch or Alexa Bliss. Just think of the stories, the movie could had with them. As for the lack of mention of her championships runs in NXT, it's alright as it build to her big win for the Divas belt from AJ Lee (Thea Trinidad) in the ending. However, that women championship is not that longstanding or well established as the film makes it out to be. In truth, it's a pretty pathetic title with a short heritage. So personally, the big win was not that interesting. While the movie did made the debut far more intense with fans jeering her and hard-hitting with actual match rather than a quick squash with audience already cheering. The fight was too clumsily put together. Plus, I kinda hate that Naomi and Tamina weren't there in the film to witness it. As for the performances. Trinidad was fine. She sound like AJ even if she didn't look like her due to Lee's trouble relationship with the company. As for producer Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson, he was fine, even if he somewhat hogged the spotlight. His presence in the film wasn't really needed. It was also nice to see cameos from other superstars even if they don't really look like that at the time. As for most of the quirkiest about Paige's family. It was well developed and delivered. Nick Frost and Lena Headey as the parents & the cameos of the real-life family members were fine even if her older half-sister didn't appear or mention in the film. However, Pugh as the lead role was a bit of a disappointment. Her acting was a bit off playing the wrestler a little too aversion. Not only that, but her appearance doesn't really match the real life Sayara. She is far too short and chubby. Also her wrestling skills were not really athletic. No wonder, why the filmmakers got Tessa Blachard to do most of the stunt work. Honestly, Tessa makes a more realistic Paige than Pugh. Better yet, why not have real-life Paige play herself. Nevertheless, the true star of the film has to go to Lowden as Zak. His dismissal sub plot about having to makes peace with himself, not making it to WWE was highly watchable & very compelling. However, unlike the real life guy who appearance and wrestling skills are average. This character had a pretty boy facial look, well tone body and amazing skills on the mat. So it doesn't make a lick of sense why he didn't get signed in the first place. At least, the original documentary show that Zak suffer from a knee injury preventing him from getting hired. As for Vince Vaughn as fictional composite trainer Hutch Morgan. He was fine. Yet, I just don't buy him as an ex-wrestler. I just wish, the movie establish more side coaches like Dusty Rhodes. It just seem odd for one man to be fully in charge of scouting, training and hiring for a global wrestling corporation without much help. Nevertheless, they did a good job of not featuring then head trainer Bill DeMott in this film, as he later resign amid accusations of abuse, misconduct and sexual harassment. That would be uncomfortable. However, it's a topic worth checking into the future. The same with showing the turbulent in her life since joining the company such as her drug suspended, her scandalous love, sex life being made public and her getting career ending injury. It would give the sequel if they make one, more depth as this movie felt a little simplified. Because of that, I felt like the film could end up being highly forgotten in the coming years like the Paige looking dishevel promo popular internet meme. This movie would get lose in the shuffle. In the end, while is Paige's house now. In a few years, it will be a house of cards. Nevertheless, this biopic has very good insight into how crazy professional wrestling really is. It offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes of WWE, and a rarer glimpse of what it takes just to get there. Even if some of the themes about overcoming adversity and hurdles has been done before in other scrappy underdog sport films. It's a step up from the other WWE Studios films.

Permalink",8,10,10.0,"Although Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson gets top billing in British writer & director Steven Merchants' amusing but insightful wrestling biography ""Fighting with My Family,"" he spends most of its 108 minutes off screen. In other words, if you're going to watch another of the Rock's conventional action thrillers, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Essentially, ""Fighting with My Family"" is the equivalent of a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), and Merchant chronicles the rise of a female British wrestler, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Outlaw King""), who had dreamed since age 13 about breaking into the WWE. In case you aren't familiar with the acronym, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., is what it means. Mind you, the WWE classifies their matches as dramatic because they amount to theatrical productions, with narrative-forged escapades orchestrated long before the talent tangle before multitudes. Approximately eight years ago, when Johnson was in the U.K., filming ""Fast & Furious 6,"" he saw a documentary about a Norwich-based family that held impromptu matches. He enjoyed it so much he contacted his ""Tooth Fairy"" co-star Steven Merchant about writing a screenplay about the Knight family's outrageous shenanigans. The patriarch of the Knight clan had wrestled professionally before he established a school for wrestlers that kept at-risk juveniles out of trouble.
As the title suggests, ""Fighting with My Family"" concerns a contentious, dysfunctional, working-class yarn about aspiring wrestlers. Nevertheless, this entertaining biopic isn't a generic, shallow account of the wrestling world that you'll forget once you've seen it. Indeed, this movie is all about female empowerment and the groundbreaking changes for women that Saraya Knight brought about as one of the youngest WWE Divas Champions. Merchant has created several sympathetic characters who experience change over time. Refusing to ridicule wrestling, Merchant has infused this factual story with as much blue-collar authenticity as if it had been made in the 196os, like the Albert Finney classic ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning."" The dialogue is literate; the performances endearing, and the humor is often subtle but never crude.
""Fighting with My Family"" concentrates on the exploits of our heroine, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Lady Macbeth""), who wasn't bitten by the wrestling bug until she turned thirteen and found herself substituting for an absent wrestler. Saraya's father, stout Ricky Knight (Nick Frost of ""Shawn of the Dead""), operates his own wrestling franchise in England. When Ricky isn't promoting tournaments, Ricky's second son Zak Knight (Jack Lowden of ""Dunkirk"") teaches at-risk adolescents, from public school to drop-outs, how to wrestle. Zak recruits all kinds, saving one teen from the misfortune of peddling contraband narcotics to lowlifes. Zak doesn't rate as much screen time as Saraya, but his impact on his sister's life is his prime contribution to the plot. Zak grew up watching the WWE. As a child, he could identify every wrestler strictly by their footwear. Obsessively, he had dreamed about wrestling in the WWE long before Saraya got converted. The WWE dispatches a gruff coach, Hutch (Vince Vaughn of ""Wedding Crashers""), to London in search of fresh blood. Saraya and Zak attend the audition with a carnival of other hopeful types in spandex. Tragically, Zak doesn't make the cut. Neither, for that matter, does anybody else, except his younger sister Saraya. Of course, she is stunned. Originally, she wanted to use the name Brittany, but the WWE already had a Brittany, so Saraya settles for Paige.
As Paige, Saraya dresses like a Goth girl: black apparel, black hair, with dark raccoon eyes. Later, during her first official bout, Paige encounters a defending champion who teases her appearance about her Halloween costume. Initially, Saraya refused to make the flight to train in Florida unless Zac came along, but Hutch refused to add her brother. Predictably, Hutch's decision crushes Zac. By all rights, Zac seemed like a shoo-in with his experience and demeanor. Over the ensuing 45 minutes, Zac struggles with the demise of his dream, momentarily careening off the rails himself in a bar fight until his older brother, Roy Knight (James Burrows of 2010's ""Robin Hood""), straightens him out. It seems Zak is a natural born teacher who inspires his students. Once Zak realizes his destiny lies with his family and the next generation of wrestlers that he can develop, he sheds his anxiety about his failure to make the WWE.
Meanwhile, Paige discovers training in sunny, faraway Florida is no picnic. She has to negotiate tough obstacle courses and flip over huge tractor tires to either shape up or ship out. At first, she alienates herself and dismisses a quartet of bimbo-like babes with golden California tans and statuesque figures. Paige's mother, Julia (Lena Headey of ""Dredd""), warns her daughter about such creatures who use their bodies to mesmerize audiences with their physical endowments. Paige dismisses them as if they were prostitutes, until she realizes that she has not only misjudged them but also herself. Hutch hovers over his recruits like a boot camp drill instructor. Constantly, he taunts them when they find the going desperate to take the easy way out and quit. Throughout these antics, Paige struggles to fit in with her cohorts, eventually dying her mane blond and spraying on a golden tan. Ultimately, it doesn't take long for our heroine to realize she cannot be somebody she isn't.
As Saraya's father Ricky, Nick Frost plays a supporting role in this cheeky comedy, but his presence makes an unforgettable impression. Wearing a shock of hair like a Mohawk Indian, Ricky is a motor-mouthed, down-to-earth, fellow. One of his best bits occurs when he auditions an aspiring wrestler who must withstand a direct blow to the face with a garbage can lid. Frost is contagiously hilarious, but he occasionally turns serious when Saraya isn't sure about her future in wrestling. The ensemble cast generates convincing charisma, and Saraya/Paige emerges triumphant despite her underdog status. ""Fighting with My Family"" qualifies as a memorable domestic melodrama as well as a first-rate wrestling masterpiece.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",39,60,8.0,"Another day, another chance to review a movie, and this morning's review is an interesting film that held much potential to be fun and unique. Sports movies seem to be the theme of this week, though this film certainly is not the typical approach to a typical sport that is portrayed in the film. Robbie K here to take a look at the British comedy about an American sports venue that continues to rake in the dough of Wrestling, and the hidden world that you might not know involved in the theatrical event. Let's get started as I take a look at:Movie: Fighting With My Family (2019)Director:
Stephen Merchant
Writer:
Stephen Merchant
Stars:
Dwayne Johnson, Lena Headey, Vince Vaughn
LIKES:Funny
Deeper Story
Training Montages
Casting
Good Utilization of Extras
Good Pace
UniqueSUMMARY:Fighting With My Family may not be the typical comedy given a lot of approaches with this movie, but my friend and I both did enjoy the comedy that was presented. It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements that I had not expected from the trailers. Character development, major themes of family, friendship, dedication, and many other subplots actually work well to provide an engaging film that isn't quite the norm for this genre. In addition, it reveals the hard work that goes into becoming a wrestler, and how physically/emotionally demanding the application process can be in something that many do not even pass a look at.
The cast certainly does the job of bringing the tale to life with Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden crushing their performances with characters that drive much of the movie, the former in particular being the central pillar to base everything around. Yet secondary characters played by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn are utilized so well that they not only avoid overshadowing, but really mesh well with the main performers. Even the tertiary characters have some good involvement in the film, showing that you can utilize the cast well and tell a very good story, even with a super celebrity in the mix. Needless to repeat, but will anyway, this film utilizes its actors very well, crafting a family component. And it is all done with a pace that is entertaining to watch, not being too caught up in the drama to be slow, and yet still going slow enough to tell much of the story. Certainly this is a unique concept, but also a unique example of how a movie can be done.DISLIKES:The Inclusion of the Extra brother
The Rapid Development of Character Relationships at Times
The Rapid Story jumps at times.
Dramatization Vs. Facts
Semi Predictable
SUMMARY:Finding dislikes for me was a little harder than I anticipated, but here are few parts of the story that were a little off my element. While the characters were done well, the extra brother that got brought in I don't think was utilized as well. Yes, he has his place, but compared to some of the other characters, his arc had some drama and potential, but then kind of fizzled out compared to what I thought they were going to do. In addition, the movie surprisingly made some good character relationships, but then progressed them a little too quickly. I was hoping that there would be a little more time with tending to the flourishing relationship they were starting to build. This is primarily during the wrestling training period where things go from zero to 100% in a relatively short amount of time, and while still good I wanted more development with them in terms of that story arc. And because of trying to fit the tale in the shorter amount of time, the movie, especially near the end led to some hasty jumps that just as things were starting to develop were quickly transitioned to the next phase. Again, I would have liked a little more fleshed out conclusions and integrations, but it certainly is not as short sheeted as some other films have done.
In regards to the dramatization, well it works to add that Hollywood magic to jazz up stories, but I do understand that those who know Paige's story might want more fact than fiction. I can't really say I know the story, but the movie works well to blend the structures with that Hollywood magic to make it entertaining. If you are fans of the story of the youngest Diva though, then brace yourself for some potential divergence. In regards to the rest of the tale, the semi predictable plot is something else difficult to ignore, though again, the rest of the movie sort of offsets this component so it's only a minor area of improvement.
The VERDICT:Surprisingly, the movie worked much better than what I was expecting from the trailers. It's balanced on many levels, telling an entertaining story, with multiple levels than the typical comedy brings to you. With great use of characters/actors, comedy that is a bit diversified, and a pace that brings the wrestling world to life, you have a fantastic film to get lost into. Yet, there are still a few other components still in need of more time than anything else, to take those components they were building and strengthen them further. I enjoyed this film a lot to warrant a trip to the theater, but can understand if you want to reserve your trips to the more special effect frenzy that other films have going for it. Definitely look for it at home though.My scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 8.5

Permalink",10,13,8.0,"I love movies that open my mind up to a world that I was not previously accustomed to. The world of professional wrestling has never once appealed to me. A staged ""sport"" where grown men in tights throw each other around to compete for a ""title belt""? Yeah, no, not for me. But if there's anything I've learned over years of seeing hundreds of movies in theaters, you have to keep your mind open. Fighting with My Family is not only a huge delight and surprise, but one that did slightly peak my interest in at least giving wrestling a shot. Anchored by the producing presence of The Rock and even acting in a few scenes, Stephen Merchant carefully crafts the story of a family of wrestlers who have dreams of making it big, only for one of their children to win a shot at the WWE over the other. Florence Pugh plays ""Paige"", the real life WWE Champion who worked her way up the WWE to become the youngest champion at age 21. Pugh, who was brilliant in The Outlaw King, gives Paige a snarky but extremely charming edge. There's no doubt in my mind, Pugh has the makings of a future Oscar winner. While the film itself likely won't win any awards, it's the definition of a crowd-pleaser.8.6/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",6,7,9.0,"I recently saw 'Ford v Ferrari' and hated every minute of it. I thought I hated every minute of it because I have a passionate dislike for motor racing. 'Fighting with My Family' is proof that that was not the case, because I also despise wrestling, yet loved this film. I couldn't believe how invested I found myself. I genuinely cared not just about the characters, but the wrestling outcome as well. If you'd told me I'd feel that way going into this movie I would've laughed in your face. Stephen Merchant is a genius.Back when Merchant and Ricky Gervais were working together Gervais was given the majority of the credit for their brilliant work. I have always maintained though that it was Merchant who was the true architect behind the brilliance, because what Gervais has achieved since Merchant left has been pitiful by comparison. Merchant's biggest strength is his structuring. He perfectly paces his films, gives every character the ideal amount of time to shine, and keeps the audience invested throughout. Then add in the fact that the man is hilarious and you have a perfect package. He is the most under-rated filmmaker working today.The cast in this movie is incredible too. Florence Pugh finishes off her almost perfect 2019. She is the glue that holds this film together. Vince Vaughan gets a role perfectly suited for him and nails it. I love it when he is given free reign to be as sarcastic as possible. He may just be the best in the business at that. Finally, Nick Frost is again in terrific form. He's hilarious and also immensely charming all at once. You can't help but love him.This movie is a comedy at its heart, but let me tell you it moved me a lot more than most out and out dramas manage to. Add to that how inspirational it is and you are left with an incredibly good film. I can't recommend this one highly enough.

Permalink",7,9,7.0,"Like all good 'sports' (or 'activity') movies, 'Fighting With My Family (2019)' cuts to the heart of its story and appeals to all audiences, whether or not they're fans of its focal pastime. In this case, that pastime is wrestling, which I have a passing knowledge of but no real deep affinity for - or, indeed, understanding of. Yet, this flick had me gripped, even during the purely in-ring segments. It follows a familiar 'rags to riches' story but sprinkles, unsurprisingly, a hefty dose of family drama on there, too. It's characters are crafted to be likeable, believable and flawed. They're given a fair bit to overcome, which is why it's all the more satisfying whenever they do so. The stakes are also slightly unconventional, usually being more internal than is customary with the genre. The comedy, while sometimes fairly broad, frequently puts a smile on your face and often makes you chuckle. It adds to the overall entertainment value of a piece that isn't afraid to veer into slightly darker territory. The narrative itself is clean and constantly forward-moving. The only real issue is the somewhat rushed finale, which makes the protagonist's shift from 'time to train' to 'this is your big shot' seem incredibly - and unbelievably - quick. It's not a huge issue, though, and the finish itself is satisfying, mainly because Merchant wisely chooses to hold his cards closer to his chest here. All of this makes for a winning formula: a feel-good, self-professed 'Rocky (1976)'-esque, funny yet heartfelt tale which might not be all that unique but earns its emotional beats and ultimate outcome pretty much twofold. 7/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",6,7,6.0,"""Fighting with My Family"" looks into the comical yet inspiring journey of Saraya 'Paige"" Bevis who climbs out of her family's independent promotion in Norwich, England to become a WWE superstar. She would become a trailblazer for today's women superstars who are known for their equally competitive edge as the men and not treated like sex objects like they were in the ""Attitude Era"" and the ""Ruthless Aggression Era"". Although the focus of the the story is based on Paige's incredible climb to the top of a major wrestling company like the WWE, it's still feels like director/writer Stephen Merchant is taking this simplified tale in the formulaic direction of a sports underdog story of an individual who has to go against the odds to reach her fullest potential and has to work through those speed bumps in order to get there. Even though WWE CEO Vince McMahon is not listed in the credits of producers, the self-promoting of this billion dollar company is so frequent, it can also be quite monotonous at times. It's like as though it wants to continually endorse its promotion like no other promotions matters.The movie follows a similar path to ""Rocky"" as we watch Saraya (Florence Pugh) break free from the shackles of her hometown in Norwich, England before taking on the persona of her Gothic-themed character Paige and challenges herself as legitimate superstar in the WWE. Even though it's a sincere biopic, Merchant does make this film dependent on funny quips and hilarious one-liners to provide a little laughter for the tough road ahead of her. The cliched tropes that come in the story are in full force. We have the tough, but fair coach Hutch Morgan (played with humour and charm by Vince Vaughn). There is musical montage that comes into full effect while she's training. And then there's the climactic battle in the ring that is supposed to be attention-grabber. And sure it lists Paige's triumphs quite nicely, they tend to forget or skim through the hardships and scandals she's faced over the years. Such things like the failed drug tests that temporarily got her fired from WWE, her estranged relationship with former WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio, the leaked sex video, and the botched wrestling move by Sasha Banks that resulted in ending her wrestling career at only 24 years old. Everything depicted in this film seems like her journey was too immaculately displayed and seems so unnaturally happy-go-lucky that everything just comes at her without repercussions.It always helps to get viewers in watching ""Fighting with My Family"" is mainly due the trailer that is mostly displayed by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and his selling the product directly at us. With his charismatic catchphrases and his poetic diatribes, this will surely get viewers to see this movie. Even though he has creative control serving as an executive producer, he's role is generally just a glorified cameo. The main performer in this movie is Florence Pugh as the aforementioned Paige who transformed the wrestling ring to ""her house"". Pugh has shown some strong performances in her young career in movies like ""Lady McBeth"" and ""Little Drummer Girl"". Backing her up are veteran performers like Lena Headey as her mother Julia and comic actor Nick Frost who starred in another Merchant movie ""Hot Fuzz"" as her father Ricky. Vince Vaughn shows one of his stronger performances in a long time as tough coach Hutch Morgan and Jack Lowden gives the more dramatic sides to the story as Saraya's brother Zack who's jealousy and depression for failing to make the cut had an affect on his family and most of all himself.The opening scenes in which the emphasis is on the the dynamics of Paige and her family of traveling wrestlers who run a promotion in her native Norwich, England. Her family is obsessed with wrestling and as the youngest and the only daughter, she has to prove herself even harder that she can accomplish bigger things in life. Her father, an ex-con, after several years of doing jobs he can't keep, found his calling running wrestling tours where his family are main attraction. He also runs a training school for wrestlers to build their strength and character and his son Zack teaches. The opening scenes are as real as they are hilarious, by the film starts to fizzle once Paige gets chosen to wrestle for NXT in hopes to be on the main roster to be a part of either two WWE weekly branded shows, RAW or Smackdown. The sibling squabbles are believable as Zack feels his world was crushed when he didn't get signed and it leads to him falling in a state of depression. It's too bad that this dramatic side of the story is just an afterthought that should have been fleshed out more. Paige's sage advice to her brother about believing in yourself and being proud of the skin you own seems like it was recited out of an old self-confident manual.And though the movie as a whole is likable, it can at times be formulaic and way too squeaky clean at times. Pugh delivers the best performance as WWE superstar Paige, the comical elements in the story can be too frequent and leaves the dramatic stuff way too underdeveloped. WWE's banter is fully protected that it heavily relies on its product placement, even though it great that they acknowledge that wrestling is predetermined, they do seems to spare the details. Also in Paige's first match it feels like it was unscripted, but I have plenty of reasons to doubt. Like this sport itself, it may make you think it's all real only to realize not everything in the world of sports entertainment appears like you'd expect.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,3,6.0,"A different type of WWE film that should please hardcore fans and newbies alike, Fighting with My Family may not knock it out of the ring but this fun, heartfelt and enjoyable true life tale is sure to bring a smile to viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Curiously directed by Office co-creator and awkward British comedian extraordinaire Stephen Merchant, Family sees the wrestling conglomerate steer away from dodgy actioners and movies starring c-grade actors to shine a light on the inspiring story of English WWE import Saraya Knight aka Paige, who took the industry by storm thanks to her fierce determination and steely resolve to make it in the cutthroat industry that chops and changes its roster on a more than frequent basis.Filled with a loaded cast that includes supporting turns from Vince Vaughan as hard as nails but caring wrestling coach Hutch, Nick Frost and Lena Heady as Knight's wrestle mad parents and a cameo from superstar (and this film's producer) Dwayne Johnson, Family is perhaps most notable moving forward as the moment its leading lady Florence Pugh officially announced herself as a leading lady of note.So good already in her breakout turn in the little seen but well regarded Lady Macbeth, the memorable TV miniseries The Little Drummer Girl and currently riding a wave of success due to her turn in buzzy horror Midsommar, there's little doubt that Pugh is quickly becoming one of the next big things in the industry and her committed turn here as Knight is a joy to behold.Perfectly balancing the act of being confident yet flawed and also self-doubtful as well as likeable and very funny, Merchant and Pugh ensure Family rides off the back of Knight and Pugh is more than up for the challenge as she turns from small time family oriented wrestler to a girl removed from her creature comforts and thrown into a world full of fakes and bloodsuckers.There are absolutely zero surprises in the journey Merchant takes us on in Family's runtime and there is a sense that everyone is made to be far too clean cut (such as how awesomely nice The Rock is) for this to be considered a true to life retelling of events but the core of the story remains enjoyable throughout and it's a credit to all that this wrestling focused dramedy is such an easy watch.Final Say -Sure to delight WWE fans of all ages and casually entertaining for the rest of us, Fighting with My Family is as generic as they come but thanks to its real life subject matter and Pugh's wickedly fun central performance, this is a film well worth tapping into.3 free hot dogs out of 5",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,3,8.0,"The WWE is one of the most dominating entertainment companies in the world today. What began as a small territorial wrestling promotion has developed into the largest wrestling promotion in the world. Not only do they handle championship wrestling on a near nightly basis they've moved into movies as well. If you don't believe that look at the career of Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock. But movies that tell the life stories of wrestlers aren't that common. That changes with FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY.In 2002 young Zak and Saraya Knight argue over what to watch, a WWF pay per view or CHARMED. While wrestling in the living room to decide their parents, Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia (Lena Headey), come in and rather than stop the fight correct their holds. Ricky is a wrestler and promoter of his own promotion. As the children grow they work in the ring alongside their parents with Zak (Jack Lowden) dreaming of the day he can join the WWE. Sister Saraya (Florence Pugh) dreams of being their alongside her older sibling.An opportunity presents itself when the WWE is set for a show in the UK. Zak and Saraya show up to try out under the watchful eye of Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughan). Since they already have a Britani in the WWE Saraya must change her name and choose Paige after one of the characters from CHARMED. Things run smooth and the pair think they stand a good chance of getting in. But it is only Saraya that is chosen. When she refuses to go without Zak he convinces her that this is the dream the family has had for years and she agrees.Saraya now Paige shows up in Florida for the WWE's NXT promotion, a lower level wrestling promotion that grooms wrestlers for the main event in the WWE. She's not like the other female wrestlers, nearly all leggy blonde models. But at 18 she's young and ready to go and has more in the ring experience than any of them combined.Being different, being the odd one out, Paige doesn't make friends and it isn't long before her disdain for their abilities shows causing more conflict within the group. Hutch pushes her, seeing something there that many would not.Back home Zak has hit rock bottom. A new father and husband, his dreams crushed, watching his sister's star rise he's torn between family loyalty and jealousy over her chance at success. Ricky and Julia aren't much better seeing Paige's rise not as something that she herself wanted but more what they wanted for themselves when they were younger as well as her being able to help promote their own business now.As the grind gets to her Paige begins to wonder if this is what she's meant for. Are the dreams of being a WWE champion really hers or are they the dreams her family wanted? Can she handle not just the physical aspects of being a professional wrestler but the emotional ones as well?The movie is one of the most entertaining flicks I've seen this year. I was truly surprised by it. Not only did it tell the real life story of a WWE star (well as real as any biopic can be) but it did it with heart as well. You don't have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this movie (though it probably helps). More than anything though I found myself laughing out loud (yes really!) more than once while watching the film. It delivers on so many levels. Superficial, probably but always entertaining.All actors here do a fantastic job of bringing what could have been cardboard cutout figures to life. Their hopes and dream can be felt, their goals achieved and crushed bring joy and pain and each one of them ties into the other to make this a movie not just about the star but the entire family. Not an easy task to achieve and yet they do.WWE stars like Dwayne Johnson, The Miz, Sheamus and Big Show also make appearances in the film and Johnson was also one of the producers for the film. WWE movies have been all over the place from good to bad. This is a good one and worth watching.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",10,15,9.0,"This docu-drama follows the incredible story of WWE superstar Paige, or Raya Knight (Florence Pugh). Born into a cheerful wrestling family, Raya and her brother Zak (Jack Lowden) get a once in a lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE. Raya earns the spot, with Zak being left behind, and Raya having to leave her family behind to compete for the spot as Diva. With rigorous coach Hutch (Vince Vaughn), Raya will be pushed to new limits while Zak faces a test moving on from his dreams. These journeys push them to fight for their family and prove what truly makes a star.Florence Pugh becomes Raya Knight/Paige with her persistence and wit towards any obstacle being very inspirational. She respectfully adapts Paige and her final speech at WrestleMania looks exactly like its real-life counterpart. Jack Lowden does the same with Zak, my favorite character, as his character arc is so relatable with his struggles to move past his dreams of making the WWE, disregarding his own wife and child. Jack shows excellent range presenting Zak's eventual passion for helping others with his family's wrestling service and taking care of his child. Nick Frost and Lena Headey, as Ricky and Julia Knight, complete the family with their uniquely jovial, but lewd attitudes that only want the best for their children and other people in need. Vince Vaughn, as Hutch, is very impressive providing an inspirational mentor for Raya, as well in his real-life friendship with the Rock. Dwayne Johnson plays himself, enough said. In all seriousness, it is very entertaining and informative to watch his real-life impact on Paige.Stephen Merchant spectacularly writes and directs, with the events presented in clear chronological order. But the real standout comes from his snappy writing, as all the jokes and emotional moments land. He truly knows how to write human and relatable characters. My favorite scene is when The Rock gives Raya's family a surprise call. Dwayne Johnson and Nick Frost truly give their all in the funniest repartee, while also giving the feels with The Rock presenting his admiration and best regards for Raya. Still, with all the positives, I feel that the film doesn't acknowledge all angles to a boxing match and the matches here feel very simplistic at times. However, the film's main intent is to flesh out the family first and then get into the nuances of the sport, so this flaw isn't particularly egregious.The message of this film is that a person's character doesn't come from the title they hold, but by one's contribution to help others. Zak holds the strongest example of this. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 due to language and sexual references.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The movie was pretty good for a casual fan you will obviously know some things were added to make it more interesting although a little bit more effort could have been added. Zelina Vega in no way represented AJ Lee from her look our even attire which i felt they may have gotten lazy on. Overall pretty decent movie felt a bit rushed and like some info was left out but was a nice attempt at putting a biopic of sorts together on a person who doesnt have extended history and a long list of memorable events in her career.

Permalink",9,13,8.0,"For a lot of kids and even adults, wrestling, especially WWE wrestling is the closest thing to watching real life superheroes and titans clashing. Sure, we all know it's a show and the callouts and insults are a part of it, but the smack downs and falls make everything look real and given the physique of the wrestlers, they still put in a lot of time to play the part and give us a circus of sweat and bruises. I don't follow it as much as I did as a child, but I have a lot of respect for the sport and show.Most of us know Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, Triple H, Big Show, John Cena, and the Rock. These are guys who've managed to create memorable characters that are almost as big as comic book heroes. But it's interesting to see what made them want to be wrestlers and how they managed to beat out other hopefuls. One such story not only focuses on the youngest woman to enter the WWE, but her family who are all die hard wrestling fans. That story is portrayed in Fighting with My Family.In the early 2010s, two English amateur wrestlers Rick (played by Nick Frost) and Julia (played by Lena Headey) and their children Zak (played by Jack Lowden) and Saraya (Played by Florence Pugh) not only love the sport, but even showcase their own matches and organize an after school practice. They also have dreams of having Zak and Saraya becoming a part of the WWE circuit with constant tapes sent in. One day when a SmackDown event is happening in London, they get a tryout with many hopefuls with WWE trainer Hutch Morgan (played by Vince Vaughn). Saraya, now gping by Paige, is selected, but her brother isn't.Paige flies to Florida for training camp, where she sticks out like a sore thumb, due to her looks and small frame. She also feels self-conscience as the other women selected look like super models. She's having trouble adapting to the WWE standards and training, and to top it off, still feels bad that her brother wasn't taken. Zac himself turns to alcohol and her parents start to make merchandise of their daughter's upcoming success. With a lot at her and moving really fast, she starts to understand that perhaps, wrestling is much more real then anticipated.Fighting with My Family does take a lot from other sports movies like the underdog plot, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm okay with that as this is really good. This movie made me realize that not only are a lot of women sports not focused on enough, but even more so in the WWE. Paige's story is not only inspiring, but the family she comes from is a lot of fun. The family's time needed to be shown in order to come out a little different from other sport movies.I really want to know what kind of training Florence Pugh went through, as I thought she was great. You really feel for her and her dilemma that she wants to be famous, but is afraid if she moves forward, then her family will be left behind. We all want to help our families, but it's understandable that things will get in the way as one climbs up the ladder. What's really going to help this movie's age is her family, who is one of the most unique families on film. They are trashy and have few manners, but they all care for each other and seems to want to help other kids that want that confidence. .One of the weaker points of the movie is Vince Vaughn. He's does fine in his part, but even with his no nonsense attitude, I still mostly saw him and not a character. I thought it was because of the actor, but I realized he was phenomenal in Hacksaw Ridge. Another problem is the pacing of the end which does show her progression after training, but it felt rushed compared to the slower first half. Perhaps there's more to the movie that was cut, but I think a little more time could have shown Paige the dilemma of suddenly being a star.I'll give this eight pictures of the real Paige out of ten. Something tells me that a lot of people, especially families, are going to like Fighting with My Family. Even if some accuse the movie as an ad for WWE, then so be it; it's like complaining that the use of the NFL in a biopic makes it an advertisement. It's a slam and worth watching.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

The Knight family has dad Ricky Knight(actor Nick Frost), mom Julia Knight (Lena Headey) , son Zak Knight and daughter Saraya Knight (actress Florence Pugh) . The whole family loves to wrestle . Saraya and Zak compete for the same WWE and coach Hutch (acted well by Vince Vaughn ends up choosing only Saraya whose new name is Paige. Paige has to leave England and home alone and go to Florida to compete with other wrestlers. Most notable competitors are 3 pretty American blondes. Paige feels very out of place but manages to shine with help of love , strength, faith in her from her family. Brother Zak , initially envious of his sister's success, gets over his insecurities . Paige has a great relationship with her brother and forces him to enjoy his girlfriend and their cute little newborn. Zak realizes his strengths and respects Paige's strengths. With the whole family backing her, Paige is victorious. Even though i do not watch wrestling /WWE this movie was very pleasant and likeable. Knight family put aside their unsophisticated ways when they have to meet Zak's girlfriend's sophisticated parents. The scenes are done well and Dwayne Johnson ""The Rock"" is very pleasant . Paige learned to wrestle while fighting with family. Paige is very level headed and actress Florence Pugh was very convincing as Paige. Jack Lowden as Zak was very convincing in showing his emotions of hurt and then great at turning his jealousy into tolerance and acceptance. The whole cast did a great job. It was nice to see actress Kim Matula as 1 of the 3 blondes ( Hope from my favorite soap Bold & Beautiful) on the big screen.

Permalink",2,2,,"Fighting with My Family chronicles the life & career of professional wrestler Paige who grew up in a wrestling fanatic family in Norwich, England that's fully devoted to sports entertainment business. The plot covers her journey from being selected for tryouts to moving to America where she trains & learns the skills of the trade, and culminates with her historic debut on Monday Night Raw.Directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is one hilarious ride but it also packs a lot of heart. The family may seem idiosyncratic but their bonding with each other has a genuine vibe to it. Add to that, it does a neat job of depicting the rite of passage every aspiring wrestler has to go through and shows that just like any other sport, it requires nothing less than blood, toil, tears & sweat to make it to the big stage.Florence Pugh plays the role of Saraya ""Paige"" Knight and delivers an outstanding performance by aptly articulating her emotions. Jack Lowden is in as her brother and shows his downhill journey with a balanced input. Nick Frost & Lena Headey portray Paige's parents and appear to be thoroughly enjoying their roles. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gets back into his old skin with ease. And Vince Vaughn chips in with solid work in the role of a WWE trainer.Overall, Fighting with My Family is a well crafted, finely narrated & wonderfully performed sports comedy that's amusing, entertaining & moving in sufficient doses. Delivering the goods with plenty of heart, it may be nostalgic to some & inspiring to others but it is by all means a welcome & heartfelt tribute to all the wrestlers who continue to put their bodies on line week after week just for the sake of entertaining us.

Permalink",2,2,8.0,"I am not a wrestling fan. I was once. I can remember a time growing up when Wrestlemania was tantamount to the Super Bowl. But times change and we grow into some things and out of others. I'd lost interest in it prior to Paige ever coming to the spotlight and had taken the stance of, ""its fake, it's bogus, I don't know how I ever watched it.""All this to say how shocked I was to watch this and LOVE it. Fighting With My Family is a marvelously funny, touching and emotional story of a girl passionate about something and struggling to achieve it. The characters are all rich and nuanced and I feel like we learn the exact right amount about each of them. It's based on a true story and, while some of the details are changed, as is often the case, the broader strokes are all pretty accurate.Florence Pugh is remarkable here. It's crazy to me to think that I've seen her now in Midsommar and Little Women and yet this is what makes me finally fall in love with her. She is exceptional here and her emotional triumph is so powerful I actually got a little choked up myself by it even when I knew what was coming. Nick Frost, as always, is a welcomed sight, as was the Rock, birth of whom were wonderful. Jack Lowden as the brother has wonderfully portrayed conflict and internal strife.The only real downside to me is that this is horribly formulaic. It follows the underdog's triumphant success story outline to the letter. At no point does it surprise me or throw a curveball to make me second guess anything. Once it starts, you know the track you're on and it never once diverted from that.That's my only negative though.

I was shocked by how much I liked it given that this movie was also produced by WWE (although I'm sure it has more to do with the Rock's production company than theirs); it's not like they are known for producing high quality movies.
I knew a little bit about Paige's (Saraya Jade Bevis) back story from watching WWE programming and reading up on her history but was still surprised by many parts eg. parents backstory. I knew that she came from a family of wrestlers but I didn't know how much the Rock influenced her career or even the phone call. I can't imagine a more cool moment for her family and for her.

When she gets the chance she finds out it is harder than she ever imagined, including leaving her home and family behind to train in the USA.All of the first half-hour and much of the remainder is in England, as such it contains much of the uniqueness of British characters, British humor, and British mannerisms.

I wouldn't have watched if it wasn't for a friend pointing out that the film is nothing like the trailer and is far better than it seems.Turns out they were right. Rather than lowest-common-denominator slapstick the plot is interesting and is complete with some great, clever humour and an engaging warmth. Moves at a good pace: the time just flies by.All this aided by some solid performances. Florence Pugh is great as Saraya and she is ably supported by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Jack Lowden as her family. Even Vince Vaughn, usually the kiss of death for any film or TV series, puts in a solid, engaging performance.All this coming from someone who is not into WWE or wrestling at all.On the negative side, it does end feeling like just another Rocky remake. Still, it was a funny and interesting journey getting there.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",26,30,7.0,"Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paige's story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you don't really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy ""Fighting with My Family"". It's a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. It's has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zak's prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once she's over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in ""Little Drummer Girl"" last year. It's Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paige's journey isn't perhaps that extraordinary. She's way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. It's not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.""Fighting with My Family"" is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I can't imagine it's going to be anybody's favourite film of all time, it's a lot of fun to watch and I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but there's a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",80,98,7.0,"Had to double take on the director and writer and make sure if it was THE Stephen Merchant writing and directing this film and it turned out it was so that was interesting. I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.The film tells the story of Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.Florence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.The film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film. Merchant does a good job.7/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Nick & Lena are her parents, who had a traveling wrestling show in England that they performed in. The whole family wrestled including her 2 brothers-one was in prison for most of the movie for getting into fights-and there were even matches with the parents verses the kids.

Permalink",18,22,6.0,"This is a very British working class comedy which centres around a wrestling mad family and their dreams of stardom. Its based on a true story and roughly around a documentary of the family made recently. At the helm is one of the writers of The Office, the superior UK version not the US remake. Also on board are a few American actors and Nick Frost from Spaced.
The tone of the movie is something like the commitments or Full Monty, you may need to be British to get some of the humour. Fortunately not all movies are made with the states in mind.
It is very funny however some of the language and scenes of violence may not make it suitable for smaller kids.
Also I have no interest or knowledge of wrestling but that didnt detract from the enjoyment of the movie.
This is not a mega-bucks The Rock vehicle, its a low key small budget UK flick with no real surprises but a few laughs along the way.
Its quite enjoyable.
Also the last thing, the reviewer know as ""thebricks"" used the final section of his review to call the UK a dump and suggest the people here just drink and fight which is highly offensive to us in the UK.
The fact that despite it being flagged twice for being offensive and off topic shows the mods do not seem to care about xenophobia.

Permalink",4,4,7.0,"Written and directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is a fictional remake of a 2012 Channel 4 documentary of the same name. Without spoiling this unconventional funny heart breaking inspiration tale too much; the film about how Saraya Bevis (Florence Pugh) became wrestling superstar Paige was a bit jarring to watch with all the historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie simplified her pre WWE career to only working for her father's struggling promotion as always as Paige; when in truth, she work for many independents companies like Shimmer as Britani Knight. While I didn't mind that, I did think the movie could had shown that she was indeed unsuccessful in her first try out for WWE before getting the job later that same year. It would had add more to her comeback story and give hope to her brother Zak (Jack Lowden). Nevertheless, when she did signed her contract. She wasn't really assigned to NXT and its high tech performance center, but to then near dead developmental territory, FCW. It's here where she got the name Paige. Once again, I didn't really mind that, however the film kinda cop out by not showing any of her real cotemporaries. Don't get me wrong, I know that most of them are no longer in the company and that they can't use their likeness for the film. However, I really couldn't get with simpleton fictional character Jeri-Lynn (Kim Matula) when there is far more interesting and compelling side real-life individuals that they could had put into the film like Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch or Alexa Bliss. Just think of the stories, the movie could had with them. As for the lack of mention of her championships runs in NXT, it's alright as it build to her big win for the Divas belt from AJ Lee (Thea Trinidad) in the ending. However, that women championship is not that longstanding or well established as the film makes it out to be. In truth, it's a pretty pathetic title with a short heritage. So personally, the big win was not that interesting. While the movie did made the debut far more intense with fans jeering her and hard-hitting with actual match rather than a quick squash with audience already cheering. The fight was too clumsily put together. Plus, I kinda hate that Naomi and Tamina weren't there in the film to witness it. As for the performances. Trinidad was fine. She sound like AJ even if she didn't look like her due to Lee's trouble relationship with the company. As for producer Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson, he was fine, even if he somewhat hogged the spotlight. His presence in the film wasn't really needed. It was also nice to see cameos from other superstars even if they don't really look like that at the time. As for most of the quirkiest about Paige's family. It was well developed and delivered. Nick Frost and Lena Headey as the parents & the cameos of the real-life family members were fine even if her older half-sister didn't appear or mention in the film. However, Pugh as the lead role was a bit of a disappointment. Her acting was a bit off playing the wrestler a little too aversion. Not only that, but her appearance doesn't really match the real life Sayara. She is far too short and chubby. Also her wrestling skills were not really athletic. No wonder, why the filmmakers got Tessa Blachard to do most of the stunt work. Honestly, Tessa makes a more realistic Paige than Pugh. Better yet, why not have real-life Paige play herself. Nevertheless, the true star of the film has to go to Lowden as Zak. His dismissal sub plot about having to makes peace with himself, not making it to WWE was highly watchable & very compelling. However, unlike the real life guy who appearance and wrestling skills are average. This character had a pretty boy facial look, well tone body and amazing skills on the mat. So it doesn't make a lick of sense why he didn't get signed in the first place. At least, the original documentary show that Zak suffer from a knee injury preventing him from getting hired. As for Vince Vaughn as fictional composite trainer Hutch Morgan. He was fine. Yet, I just don't buy him as an ex-wrestler. I just wish, the movie establish more side coaches like Dusty Rhodes. It just seem odd for one man to be fully in charge of scouting, training and hiring for a global wrestling corporation without much help. Nevertheless, they did a good job of not featuring then head trainer Bill DeMott in this film, as he later resign amid accusations of abuse, misconduct and sexual harassment. That would be uncomfortable. However, it's a topic worth checking into the future. The same with showing the turbulent in her life since joining the company such as her drug suspended, her scandalous love, sex life being made public and her getting career ending injury. It would give the sequel if they make one, more depth as this movie felt a little simplified. Because of that, I felt like the film could end up being highly forgotten in the coming years like the Paige looking dishevel promo popular internet meme. This movie would get lose in the shuffle. In the end, while is Paige's house now. In a few years, it will be a house of cards. Nevertheless, this biopic has very good insight into how crazy professional wrestling really is. It offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes of WWE, and a rarer glimpse of what it takes just to get there. Even if some of the themes about overcoming adversity and hurdles has been done before in other scrappy underdog sport films. It's a step up from the other WWE Studios films.

Permalink",8,10,10.0,"Although Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson gets top billing in British writer & director Steven Merchants' amusing but insightful wrestling biography ""Fighting with My Family,"" he spends most of its 108 minutes off screen. In other words, if you're going to watch another of the Rock's conventional action thrillers, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Essentially, ""Fighting with My Family"" is the equivalent of a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), and Merchant chronicles the rise of a female British wrestler, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Outlaw King""), who had dreamed since age 13 about breaking into the WWE. In case you aren't familiar with the acronym, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., is what it means. Mind you, the WWE classifies their matches as dramatic because they amount to theatrical productions, with narrative-forged escapades orchestrated long before the talent tangle before multitudes. Approximately eight years ago, when Johnson was in the U.K., filming ""Fast & Furious 6,"" he saw a documentary about a Norwich-based family that held impromptu matches. He enjoyed it so much he contacted his ""Tooth Fairy"" co-star Steven Merchant about writing a screenplay about the Knight family's outrageous shenanigans. The patriarch of the Knight clan had wrestled professionally before he established a school for wrestlers that kept at-risk juveniles out of trouble.
As the title suggests, ""Fighting with My Family"" concerns a contentious, dysfunctional, working-class yarn about aspiring wrestlers. Nevertheless, this entertaining biopic isn't a generic, shallow account of the wrestling world that you'll forget once you've seen it. Indeed, this movie is all about female empowerment and the groundbreaking changes for women that Saraya Knight brought about as one of the youngest WWE Divas Champions. Merchant has created several sympathetic characters who experience change over time. Refusing to ridicule wrestling, Merchant has infused this factual story with as much blue-collar authenticity as if it had been made in the 196os, like the Albert Finney classic ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning."" The dialogue is literate; the performances endearing, and the humor is often subtle but never crude.
""Fighting with My Family"" concentrates on the exploits of our heroine, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Lady Macbeth""), who wasn't bitten by the wrestling bug until she turned thirteen and found herself substituting for an absent wrestler. Saraya's father, stout Ricky Knight (Nick Frost of ""Shawn of the Dead""), operates his own wrestling franchise in England. When Ricky isn't promoting tournaments, Ricky's second son Zak Knight (Jack Lowden of ""Dunkirk"") teaches at-risk adolescents, from public school to drop-outs, how to wrestle. Zak recruits all kinds, saving one teen from the misfortune of peddling contraband narcotics to lowlifes. Zak doesn't rate as much screen time as Saraya, but his impact on his sister's life is his prime contribution to the plot. Zak grew up watching the WWE. As a child, he could identify every wrestler strictly by their footwear. Obsessively, he had dreamed about wrestling in the WWE long before Saraya got converted. The WWE dispatches a gruff coach, Hutch (Vince Vaughn of ""Wedding Crashers""), to London in search of fresh blood. Saraya and Zak attend the audition with a carnival of other hopeful types in spandex. Tragically, Zak doesn't make the cut. Neither, for that matter, does anybody else, except his younger sister Saraya. Of course, she is stunned. Originally, she wanted to use the name Brittany, but the WWE already had a Brittany, so Saraya settles for Paige.
As Paige, Saraya dresses like a Goth girl: black apparel, black hair, with dark raccoon eyes. Later, during her first official bout, Paige encounters a defending champion who teases her appearance about her Halloween costume. Initially, Saraya refused to make the flight to train in Florida unless Zac came along, but Hutch refused to add her brother. Predictably, Hutch's decision crushes Zac. By all rights, Zac seemed like a shoo-in with his experience and demeanor. Over the ensuing 45 minutes, Zac struggles with the demise of his dream, momentarily careening off the rails himself in a bar fight until his older brother, Roy Knight (James Burrows of 2010's ""Robin Hood""), straightens him out. It seems Zak is a natural born teacher who inspires his students. Once Zak realizes his destiny lies with his family and the next generation of wrestlers that he can develop, he sheds his anxiety about his failure to make the WWE.
Meanwhile, Paige discovers training in sunny, faraway Florida is no picnic. She has to negotiate tough obstacle courses and flip over huge tractor tires to either shape up or ship out. At first, she alienates herself and dismisses a quartet of bimbo-like babes with golden California tans and statuesque figures. Paige's mother, Julia (Lena Headey of ""Dredd""), warns her daughter about such creatures who use their bodies to mesmerize audiences with their physical endowments. Paige dismisses them as if they were prostitutes, until she realizes that she has not only misjudged them but also herself. Hutch hovers over his recruits like a boot camp drill instructor. Constantly, he taunts them when they find the going desperate to take the easy way out and quit. Throughout these antics, Paige struggles to fit in with her cohorts, eventually dying her mane blond and spraying on a golden tan. Ultimately, it doesn't take long for our heroine to realize she cannot be somebody she isn't.
As Saraya's father Ricky, Nick Frost plays a supporting role in this cheeky comedy, but his presence makes an unforgettable impression. Wearing a shock of hair like a Mohawk Indian, Ricky is a motor-mouthed, down-to-earth, fellow. One of his best bits occurs when he auditions an aspiring wrestler who must withstand a direct blow to the face with a garbage can lid. Frost is contagiously hilarious, but he occasionally turns serious when Saraya isn't sure about her future in wrestling. The ensemble cast generates convincing charisma, and Saraya/Paige emerges triumphant despite her underdog status. ""Fighting with My Family"" qualifies as a memorable domestic melodrama as well as a first-rate wrestling masterpiece.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",39,60,8.0,"Another day, another chance to review a movie, and this morning's review is an interesting film that held much potential to be fun and unique. Sports movies seem to be the theme of this week, though this film certainly is not the typical approach to a typical sport that is portrayed in the film. Robbie K here to take a look at the British comedy about an American sports venue that continues to rake in the dough of Wrestling, and the hidden world that you might not know involved in the theatrical event. Let's get started as I take a look at:Movie: Fighting With My Family (2019)Director:
Stephen Merchant
Writer:
Stephen Merchant
Stars:
Dwayne Johnson, Lena Headey, Vince Vaughn
LIKES:Funny
Deeper Story
Training Montages
Casting
Good Utilization of Extras
Good Pace
UniqueSUMMARY:Fighting With My Family may not be the typical comedy given a lot of approaches with this movie, but my friend and I both did enjoy the comedy that was presented. It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements that I had not expected from the trailers. Character development, major themes of family, friendship, dedication, and many other subplots actually work well to provide an engaging film that isn't quite the norm for this genre. In addition, it reveals the hard work that goes into becoming a wrestler, and how physically/emotionally demanding the application process can be in something that many do not even pass a look at.
The cast certainly does the job of bringing the tale to life with Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden crushing their performances with characters that drive much of the movie, the former in particular being the central pillar to base everything around. Yet secondary characters played by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn are utilized so well that they not only avoid overshadowing, but really mesh well with the main performers. Even the tertiary characters have some good involvement in the film, showing that you can utilize the cast well and tell a very good story, even with a super celebrity in the mix. Needless to repeat, but will anyway, this film utilizes its actors very well, crafting a family component. And it is all done with a pace that is entertaining to watch, not being too caught up in the drama to be slow, and yet still going slow enough to tell much of the story. Certainly this is a unique concept, but also a unique example of how a movie can be done.DISLIKES:The Inclusion of the Extra brother
The Rapid Development of Character Relationships at Times
The Rapid Story jumps at times.
Dramatization Vs. Facts
Semi Predictable
SUMMARY:Finding dislikes for me was a little harder than I anticipated, but here are few parts of the story that were a little off my element. While the characters were done well, the extra brother that got brought in I don't think was utilized as well. Yes, he has his place, but compared to some of the other characters, his arc had some drama and potential, but then kind of fizzled out compared to what I thought they were going to do. In addition, the movie surprisingly made some good character relationships, but then progressed them a little too quickly. I was hoping that there would be a little more time with tending to the flourishing relationship they were starting to build. This is primarily during the wrestling training period where things go from zero to 100% in a relatively short amount of time, and while still good I wanted more development with them in terms of that story arc. And because of trying to fit the tale in the shorter amount of time, the movie, especially near the end led to some hasty jumps that just as things were starting to develop were quickly transitioned to the next phase. Again, I would have liked a little more fleshed out conclusions and integrations, but it certainly is not as short sheeted as some other films have done.
In regards to the dramatization, well it works to add that Hollywood magic to jazz up stories, but I do understand that those who know Paige's story might want more fact than fiction. I can't really say I know the story, but the movie works well to blend the structures with that Hollywood magic to make it entertaining. If you are fans of the story of the youngest Diva though, then brace yourself for some potential divergence. In regards to the rest of the tale, the semi predictable plot is something else difficult to ignore, though again, the rest of the movie sort of offsets this component so it's only a minor area of improvement.
The VERDICT:Surprisingly, the movie worked much better than what I was expecting from the trailers. It's balanced on many levels, telling an entertaining story, with multiple levels than the typical comedy brings to you. With great use of characters/actors, comedy that is a bit diversified, and a pace that brings the wrestling world to life, you have a fantastic film to get lost into. Yet, there are still a few other components still in need of more time than anything else, to take those components they were building and strengthen them further. I enjoyed this film a lot to warrant a trip to the theater, but can understand if you want to reserve your trips to the more special effect frenzy that other films have going for it. Definitely look for it at home though.My scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 8.5

Permalink",10,13,8.0,"I love movies that open my mind up to a world that I was not previously accustomed to. The world of professional wrestling has never once appealed to me. A staged ""sport"" where grown men in tights throw each other around to compete for a ""title belt""? Yeah, no, not for me. But if there's anything I've learned over years of seeing hundreds of movies in theaters, you have to keep your mind open. Fighting with My Family is not only a huge delight and surprise, but one that did slightly peak my interest in at least giving wrestling a shot. Anchored by the producing presence of The Rock and even acting in a few scenes, Stephen Merchant carefully crafts the story of a family of wrestlers who have dreams of making it big, only for one of their children to win a shot at the WWE over the other. Florence Pugh plays ""Paige"", the real life WWE Champion who worked her way up the WWE to become the youngest champion at age 21. Pugh, who was brilliant in The Outlaw King, gives Paige a snarky but extremely charming edge. There's no doubt in my mind, Pugh has the makings of a future Oscar winner. While the film itself likely won't win any awards, it's the definition of a crowd-pleaser.8.6/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",6,7,9.0,"I recently saw 'Ford v Ferrari' and hated every minute of it. I thought I hated every minute of it because I have a passionate dislike for motor racing. 'Fighting with My Family' is proof that that was not the case, because I also despise wrestling, yet loved this film. I couldn't believe how invested I found myself. I genuinely cared not just about the characters, but the wrestling outcome as well. If you'd told me I'd feel that way going into this movie I would've laughed in your face. Stephen Merchant is a genius.Back when Merchant and Ricky Gervais were working together Gervais was given the majority of the credit for their brilliant work. I have always maintained though that it was Merchant who was the true architect behind the brilliance, because what Gervais has achieved since Merchant left has been pitiful by comparison. Merchant's biggest strength is his structuring. He perfectly paces his films, gives every character the ideal amount of time to shine, and keeps the audience invested throughout. Then add in the fact that the man is hilarious and you have a perfect package. He is the most under-rated filmmaker working today.The cast in this movie is incredible too. Florence Pugh finishes off her almost perfect 2019. She is the glue that holds this film together. Vince Vaughan gets a role perfectly suited for him and nails it. I love it when he is given free reign to be as sarcastic as possible. He may just be the best in the business at that. Finally, Nick Frost is again in terrific form. He's hilarious and also immensely charming all at once. You can't help but love him.This movie is a comedy at its heart, but let me tell you it moved me a lot more than most out and out dramas manage to. Add to that how inspirational it is and you are left with an incredibly good film. I can't recommend this one highly enough.

Permalink",7,9,7.0,"Like all good 'sports' (or 'activity') movies, 'Fighting With My Family (2019)' cuts to the heart of its story and appeals to all audiences, whether or not they're fans of its focal pastime. In this case, that pastime is wrestling, which I have a passing knowledge of but no real deep affinity for - or, indeed, understanding of. Yet, this flick had me gripped, even during the purely in-ring segments. It follows a familiar 'rags to riches' story but sprinkles, unsurprisingly, a hefty dose of family drama on there, too. It's characters are crafted to be likeable, believable and flawed. They're given a fair bit to overcome, which is why it's all the more satisfying whenever they do so. The stakes are also slightly unconventional, usually being more internal than is customary with the genre. The comedy, while sometimes fairly broad, frequently puts a smile on your face and often makes you chuckle. It adds to the overall entertainment value of a piece that isn't afraid to veer into slightly darker territory. The narrative itself is clean and constantly forward-moving. The only real issue is the somewhat rushed finale, which makes the protagonist's shift from 'time to train' to 'this is your big shot' seem incredibly - and unbelievably - quick. It's not a huge issue, though, and the finish itself is satisfying, mainly because Merchant wisely chooses to hold his cards closer to his chest here. All of this makes for a winning formula: a feel-good, self-professed 'Rocky (1976)'-esque, funny yet heartfelt tale which might not be all that unique but earns its emotional beats and ultimate outcome pretty much twofold. 7/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",6,7,6.0,"""Fighting with My Family"" looks into the comical yet inspiring journey of Saraya 'Paige"" Bevis who climbs out of her family's independent promotion in Norwich, England to become a WWE superstar. She would become a trailblazer for today's women superstars who are known for their equally competitive edge as the men and not treated like sex objects like they were in the ""Attitude Era"" and the ""Ruthless Aggression Era"". Although the focus of the the story is based on Paige's incredible climb to the top of a major wrestling company like the WWE, it's still feels like director/writer Stephen Merchant is taking this simplified tale in the formulaic direction of a sports underdog story of an individual who has to go against the odds to reach her fullest potential and has to work through those speed bumps in order to get there. Even though WWE CEO Vince McMahon is not listed in the credits of producers, the self-promoting of this billion dollar company is so frequent, it can also be quite monotonous at times. It's like as though it wants to continually endorse its promotion like no other promotions matters.The movie follows a similar path to ""Rocky"" as we watch Saraya (Florence Pugh) break free from the shackles of her hometown in Norwich, England before taking on the persona of her Gothic-themed character Paige and challenges herself as legitimate superstar in the WWE. Even though it's a sincere biopic, Merchant does make this film dependent on funny quips and hilarious one-liners to provide a little laughter for the tough road ahead of her. The cliched tropes that come in the story are in full force. We have the tough, but fair coach Hutch Morgan (played with humour and charm by Vince Vaughn). There is musical montage that comes into full effect while she's training. And then there's the climactic battle in the ring that is supposed to be attention-grabber. And sure it lists Paige's triumphs quite nicely, they tend to forget or skim through the hardships and scandals she's faced over the years. Such things like the failed drug tests that temporarily got her fired from WWE, her estranged relationship with former WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio, the leaked sex video, and the botched wrestling move by Sasha Banks that resulted in ending her wrestling career at only 24 years old. Everything depicted in this film seems like her journey was too immaculately displayed and seems so unnaturally happy-go-lucky that everything just comes at her without repercussions.It always helps to get viewers in watching ""Fighting with My Family"" is mainly due the trailer that is mostly displayed by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and his selling the product directly at us. With his charismatic catchphrases and his poetic diatribes, this will surely get viewers to see this movie. Even though he has creative control serving as an executive producer, he's role is generally just a glorified cameo. The main performer in this movie is Florence Pugh as the aforementioned Paige who transformed the wrestling ring to ""her house"". Pugh has shown some strong performances in her young career in movies like ""Lady McBeth"" and ""Little Drummer Girl"". Backing her up are veteran performers like Lena Headey as her mother Julia and comic actor Nick Frost who starred in another Merchant movie ""Hot Fuzz"" as her father Ricky. Vince Vaughn shows one of his stronger performances in a long time as tough coach Hutch Morgan and Jack Lowden gives the more dramatic sides to the story as Saraya's brother Zack who's jealousy and depression for failing to make the cut had an affect on his family and most of all himself.The opening scenes in which the emphasis is on the the dynamics of Paige and her family of traveling wrestlers who run a promotion in her native Norwich, England. Her family is obsessed with wrestling and as the youngest and the only daughter, she has to prove herself even harder that she can accomplish bigger things in life. Her father, an ex-con, after several years of doing jobs he can't keep, found his calling running wrestling tours where his family are main attraction. He also runs a training school for wrestlers to build their strength and character and his son Zack teaches. The opening scenes are as real as they are hilarious, by the film starts to fizzle once Paige gets chosen to wrestle for NXT in hopes to be on the main roster to be a part of either two WWE weekly branded shows, RAW or Smackdown. The sibling squabbles are believable as Zack feels his world was crushed when he didn't get signed and it leads to him falling in a state of depression. It's too bad that this dramatic side of the story is just an afterthought that should have been fleshed out more. Paige's sage advice to her brother about believing in yourself and being proud of the skin you own seems like it was recited out of an old self-confident manual.And though the movie as a whole is likable, it can at times be formulaic and way too squeaky clean at times. Pugh delivers the best performance as WWE superstar Paige, the comical elements in the story can be too frequent and leaves the dramatic stuff way too underdeveloped. WWE's banter is fully protected that it heavily relies on its product placement, even though it great that they acknowledge that wrestling is predetermined, they do seems to spare the details. Also in Paige's first match it feels like it was unscripted, but I have plenty of reasons to doubt. Like this sport itself, it may make you think it's all real only to realize not everything in the world of sports entertainment appears like you'd expect.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,3,6.0,"A different type of WWE film that should please hardcore fans and newbies alike, Fighting with My Family may not knock it out of the ring but this fun, heartfelt and enjoyable true life tale is sure to bring a smile to viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Curiously directed by Office co-creator and awkward British comedian extraordinaire Stephen Merchant, Family sees the wrestling conglomerate steer away from dodgy actioners and movies starring c-grade actors to shine a light on the inspiring story of English WWE import Saraya Knight aka Paige, who took the industry by storm thanks to her fierce determination and steely resolve to make it in the cutthroat industry that chops and changes its roster on a more than frequent basis.Filled with a loaded cast that includes supporting turns from Vince Vaughan as hard as nails but caring wrestling coach Hutch, Nick Frost and Lena Heady as Knight's wrestle mad parents and a cameo from superstar (and this film's producer) Dwayne Johnson, Family is perhaps most notable moving forward as the moment its leading lady Florence Pugh officially announced herself as a leading lady of note.So good already in her breakout turn in the little seen but well regarded Lady Macbeth, the memorable TV miniseries The Little Drummer Girl and currently riding a wave of success due to her turn in buzzy horror Midsommar, there's little doubt that Pugh is quickly becoming one of the next big things in the industry and her committed turn here as Knight is a joy to behold.Perfectly balancing the act of being confident yet flawed and also self-doubtful as well as likeable and very funny, Merchant and Pugh ensure Family rides off the back of Knight and Pugh is more than up for the challenge as she turns from small time family oriented wrestler to a girl removed from her creature comforts and thrown into a world full of fakes and bloodsuckers.There are absolutely zero surprises in the journey Merchant takes us on in Family's runtime and there is a sense that everyone is made to be far too clean cut (such as how awesomely nice The Rock is) for this to be considered a true to life retelling of events but the core of the story remains enjoyable throughout and it's a credit to all that this wrestling focused dramedy is such an easy watch.Final Say -Sure to delight WWE fans of all ages and casually entertaining for the rest of us, Fighting with My Family is as generic as they come but thanks to its real life subject matter and Pugh's wickedly fun central performance, this is a film well worth tapping into.3 free hot dogs out of 5",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,3,8.0,"The WWE is one of the most dominating entertainment companies in the world today. What began as a small territorial wrestling promotion has developed into the largest wrestling promotion in the world. Not only do they handle championship wrestling on a near nightly basis they've moved into movies as well. If you don't believe that look at the career of Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock. But movies that tell the life stories of wrestlers aren't that common. That changes with FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY.In 2002 young Zak and Saraya Knight argue over what to watch, a WWF pay per view or CHARMED. While wrestling in the living room to decide their parents, Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia (Lena Headey), come in and rather than stop the fight correct their holds. Ricky is a wrestler and promoter of his own promotion. As the children grow they work in the ring alongside their parents with Zak (Jack Lowden) dreaming of the day he can join the WWE. Sister Saraya (Florence Pugh) dreams of being their alongside her older sibling.An opportunity presents itself when the WWE is set for a show in the UK. Zak and Saraya show up to try out under the watchful eye of Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughan). Since they already have a Britani in the WWE Saraya must change her name and choose Paige after one of the characters from CHARMED. Things run smooth and the pair think they stand a good chance of getting in. But it is only Saraya that is chosen. When she refuses to go without Zak he convinces her that this is the dream the family has had for years and she agrees.Saraya now Paige shows up in Florida for the WWE's NXT promotion, a lower level wrestling promotion that grooms wrestlers for the main event in the WWE. She's not like the other female wrestlers, nearly all leggy blonde models. But at 18 she's young and ready to go and has more in the ring experience than any of them combined.Being different, being the odd one out, Paige doesn't make friends and it isn't long before her disdain for their abilities shows causing more conflict within the group. Hutch pushes her, seeing something there that many would not.Back home Zak has hit rock bottom. A new father and husband, his dreams crushed, watching his sister's star rise he's torn between family loyalty and jealousy over her chance at success. Ricky and Julia aren't much better seeing Paige's rise not as something that she herself wanted but more what they wanted for themselves when they were younger as well as her being able to help promote their own business now.As the grind gets to her Paige begins to wonder if this is what she's meant for. Are the dreams of being a WWE champion really hers or are they the dreams her family wanted? Can she handle not just the physical aspects of being a professional wrestler but the emotional ones as well?The movie is one of the most entertaining flicks I've seen this year. I was truly surprised by it. Not only did it tell the real life story of a WWE star (well as real as any biopic can be) but it did it with heart as well. You don't have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this movie (though it probably helps). More than anything though I found myself laughing out loud (yes really!) more than once while watching the film. It delivers on so many levels. Superficial, probably but always entertaining.All actors here do a fantastic job of bringing what could have been cardboard cutout figures to life. Their hopes and dream can be felt, their goals achieved and crushed bring joy and pain and each one of them ties into the other to make this a movie not just about the star but the entire family. Not an easy task to achieve and yet they do.WWE stars like Dwayne Johnson, The Miz, Sheamus and Big Show also make appearances in the film and Johnson was also one of the producers for the film. WWE movies have been all over the place from good to bad.

Permalink",10,15,9.0,"This docu-drama follows the incredible story of WWE superstar Paige, or Raya Knight (Florence Pugh). Born into a cheerful wrestling family, Raya and her brother Zak (Jack Lowden) get a once in a lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE. Raya earns the spot, with Zak being left behind, and Raya having to leave her family behind to compete for the spot as Diva. With rigorous coach Hutch (Vince Vaughn), Raya will be pushed to new limits while Zak faces a test moving on from his dreams. These journeys push them to fight for their family and prove what truly makes a star.Florence Pugh becomes Raya Knight/Paige with her persistence and wit towards any obstacle being very inspirational. She respectfully adapts Paige and her final speech at WrestleMania looks exactly like its real-life counterpart. Jack Lowden does the same with Zak, my favorite character, as his character arc is so relatable with his struggles to move past his dreams of making the WWE, disregarding his own wife and child. Jack shows excellent range presenting Zak's eventual passion for helping others with his family's wrestling service and taking care of his child. Nick Frost and Lena Headey, as Ricky and Julia Knight, complete the family with their uniquely jovial, but lewd attitudes that only want the best for their children and other people in need. Vince Vaughn, as Hutch, is very impressive providing an inspirational mentor for Raya, as well in his real-life friendship with the Rock. Dwayne Johnson plays himself, enough said. In all seriousness, it is very entertaining and informative to watch his real-life impact on Paige.Stephen Merchant spectacularly writes and directs, with the events presented in clear chronological order. But the real standout comes from his snappy writing, as all the jokes and emotional moments land. He truly knows how to write human and relatable characters. My favorite scene is when The Rock gives Raya's family a surprise call. Dwayne Johnson and Nick Frost truly give their all in the funniest repartee, while also giving the feels with The Rock presenting his admiration and best regards for Raya. Still, with all the positives, I feel that the film doesn't acknowledge all angles to a boxing match and the matches here feel very simplistic at times. However, the film's main intent is to flesh out the family first and then get into the nuances of the sport, so this flaw isn't particularly egregious.The message of this film is that a person's character doesn't come from the title they hold, but by one's contribution to help others. Zak holds the strongest example of this. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 due to language and sexual references.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Permalink",9,13,8.0,"For a lot of kids and even adults, wrestling, especially WWE wrestling is the closest thing to watching real life superheroes and titans clashing. Sure, we all know it's a show and the callouts and insults are a part of it, but the smack downs and falls make everything look real and given the physique of the wrestlers, they still put in a lot of time to play the part and give us a circus of sweat and bruises. I don't follow it as much as I did as a child, but I have a lot of respect for the sport and show.Most of us know Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, Triple H, Big Show, John Cena, and the Rock. These are guys who've managed to create memorable characters that are almost as big as comic book heroes. But it's interesting to see what made them want to be wrestlers and how they managed to beat out other hopefuls. One such story not only focuses on the youngest woman to enter the WWE, but her family who are all die hard wrestling fans. That story is portrayed in Fighting with My Family.In the early 2010s, two English amateur wrestlers Rick (played by Nick Frost) and Julia (played by Lena Headey) and their children Zak (played by Jack Lowden) and Saraya (Played by Florence Pugh) not only love the sport, but even showcase their own matches and organize an after school practice. They also have dreams of having Zak and Saraya becoming a part of the WWE circuit with constant tapes sent in. One day when a SmackDown event is happening in London, they get a tryout with many hopefuls with WWE trainer Hutch Morgan (played by Vince Vaughn). Saraya, now gping by Paige, is selected, but her brother isn't.Paige flies to Florida for training camp, where she sticks out like a sore thumb, due to her looks and small frame. She also feels self-conscience as the other women selected look like super models. She's having trouble adapting to the WWE standards and training, and to top it off, still feels bad that her brother wasn't taken. Zac himself turns to alcohol and her parents start to make merchandise of their daughter's upcoming success. With a lot at her and moving really fast, she starts to understand that perhaps, wrestling is much more real then anticipated.Fighting with My Family does take a lot from other sports movies like the underdog plot, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm okay with that as this is really good. This movie made me realize that not only are a lot of women sports not focused on enough, but even more so in the WWE. Paige's story is not only inspiring, but the family she comes from is a lot of fun. The family's time needed to be shown in order to come out a little different from other sport movies.I really want to know what kind of training Florence Pugh went through, as I thought she was great. You really feel for her and her dilemma that she wants to be famous, but is afraid if she moves forward, then her family will be left behind. We all want to help our families, but it's understandable that things will get in the way as one climbs up the ladder. What's really going to help this movie's age is her family, who is one of the most unique families on film. They are trashy and have few manners, but they all care for each other and seems to want to help other kids that want that confidence. .One of the weaker points of the movie is Vince Vaughn. He's does fine in his part, but even with his no nonsense attitude, I still mostly saw him and not a character. I thought it was because of the actor, but I realized he was phenomenal in Hacksaw Ridge. Another problem is the pacing of the end which does show her progression after training, but it felt rushed compared to the slower first half. Perhaps there's more to the movie that was cut, but I think a little more time could have shown Paige the dilemma of suddenly being a star.I'll give this eight pictures of the real Paige out of ten. Something tells me that a lot of people, especially families, are going to like Fighting with My Family. Even if some accuse the movie as an ad for WWE, then so be it; it's like complaining that the use of the NFL in a biopic makes it an advertisement. It's a slam and worth watching.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Paige learned to wrestle while fighting with family. Paige is very level headed and actress Florence Pugh was very convincing as Paige. Jack Lowden as Zak was very convincing in showing his emotions of hurt and then great at turning his jealousy into tolerance and acceptance. The whole cast did a great job.

Permalink",2,2,,"Fighting with My Family chronicles the life & career of professional wrestler Paige who grew up in a wrestling fanatic family in Norwich, England that's fully devoted to sports entertainment business. The plot covers her journey from being selected for tryouts to moving to America where she trains & learns the skills of the trade, and culminates with her historic debut on Monday Night Raw.Directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is one hilarious ride but it also packs a lot of heart. The family may seem idiosyncratic but their bonding with each other has a genuine vibe to it. Add to that, it does a neat job of depicting the rite of passage every aspiring wrestler has to go through and shows that just like any other sport, it requires nothing less than blood, toil, tears & sweat to make it to the big stage.Florence Pugh plays the role of Saraya ""Paige"" Knight and delivers an outstanding performance by aptly articulating her emotions. Jack Lowden is in as her brother and shows his downhill journey with a balanced input. Nick Frost & Lena Headey portray Paige's parents and appear to be thoroughly enjoying their roles. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gets back into his old skin with ease. And Vince Vaughn chips in with solid work in the role of a WWE trainer.Overall, Fighting with My Family is a well crafted, finely narrated & wonderfully performed sports comedy that's amusing, entertaining & moving in sufficient doses. Delivering the goods with plenty of heart, it may be nostalgic to some & inspiring to others but it is by all means a welcome & heartfelt tribute to all the wrestlers who continue to put their bodies on line week after week just for the sake of entertaining us.

Permalink",2,2,8.0,"I am not a wrestling fan. I was once. I can remember a time growing up when Wrestlemania was tantamount to the Super Bowl. But times change and we grow into some things and out of others. I'd lost interest in it prior to Paige ever coming to the spotlight and had taken the stance of, ""its fake, it's bogus, I don't know how I ever watched it.""All this to say how shocked I was to watch this and LOVE it. Fighting With My Family is a marvelously funny, touching and emotional story of a girl passionate about something and struggling to achieve it. The characters are all rich and nuanced and I feel like we learn the exact right amount about each of them. It's based on a true story and, while some of the details are changed, as is often the case, the broader strokes are all pretty accurate.Florence Pugh is remarkable here. It's crazy to me to think that I've seen her now in Midsommar and Little Women and yet this is what makes me finally fall in love with her. She is exceptional here and her emotional triumph is so powerful I actually got a little choked up myself by it even when I knew what was coming. Nick Frost, as always, is a welcomed sight, as was the Rock, birth of whom were wonderful. Jack Lowden as the brother has wonderfully portrayed conflict and internal strife.The only real downside to me is that this is horribly formulaic. It follows the underdog's triumphant success story outline to the letter. At no point does it surprise me or throw a curveball to make me second guess anything.

Permalink",3,3,8.0,"I had heard that this movie was getting decent reviews so I decided I would check it out. I was shocked by how much I liked it given that this movie was also produced by WWE (although I'm sure it has more to do with the Rock's production company than theirs); it's not like they are known for producing high quality movies.
I knew a little bit about Paige's (Saraya Jade Bevis) back story from watching WWE programming and reading up on her history but was still surprised by many parts eg. parents backstory. I knew that she came from a family of wrestlers but I didn't know how much the Rock influenced her career or even the phone call. I can't imagine a more cool moment for her family and for her.
This is a good movie about hope, devastation, following your dreams, and most importantly believing in yourself. This movie is definitely a must watch for those who appreciate the art of professional wrestling but should not be seen by the very young due to coarse language",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,4,9.0,"Fighting with My Family (4.5 out of 5 stars).Fighting with My Family is an energetic, fun, and good biographical sports comedy drama film. The film is based on a WWE wrestler Paige also known as Saraya. The film follows her younger years, when she was a child fighting with her young brother Zak over a tv remote. Her parents were encouraging them both on learning to wrestle. They have their own wrestling gym which they pick up kids and teens on the street to learn to train and be a better person. Paige and Zak get a call to tryout for the WWE. Which Paige gets in and her brother doesn't. Causing a little distant drama between them. Paige trains herself hard and tries to follow her dreams of being a professional wrestler.It was great plot and story about Paige. Her family lives in England. They were struggling with money. But they still followed their dreams of keeping their gym open for kids and teens to keep them away from trouble on the street. The drama with Zak being heartbroken he did not make the try outs. And Paige is going somewhere as her trainer sees something in her. It is a fun journey to see how she goes through training. She faces against other contenders which they try to cause drama. And her parents being inspiring while her brother falls into depression.The direction is fast paced, energetic, and it kept the story moving. It is an inspiring story. The acting is great. Florence Pugh delivered her role. She is great. Lena Headey and Nick Frost playing her parents were great too. Jack Lowden playing her brother Zak was good. Vince Vaughn playing her recruiter and trainer was great. Dwayne Johnson makes a fun appearance as himself.Overall, Fighting with My Family is a pretty exciting and good film. It has an inspiring plot, good acting and direction. If you are not a wrestling fan or are, it is fun to see how these young wrestlers are put to the test to become a professional WWE wrestler.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",7,12,8.0,"This movie is a true story based upon the Wright family in Norwich who found redemption in wrestling (almost a religion). After a period on the wrong side of the law Mr Wright just knew where his downward spiral would lead and to save his life, his marriage and his family he turned to wrestling. Mr Wright believed profoundly in the power of wrestling, its discipline, its camaraderie, its training, its teamwork to keep his family on the straight and narrow and if it could work for him it could work for the community to transform lives.The impossible dream for these amateur wrestlers was to make it ""big"" and be signed up for the American wrestling circuit. But to have a distant dream and then that dream present itself, and then see it through is quite a different thing.This was a carefully crafted movie with a tight script brilliantly acted by the entire ensemble. The two main leads Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden demonstrated an emotional intensity well beyond their years, we felt their pain and anguish and their joy and triumph.This movie did not descend into sentimental mush or become so British that it alienated its audience with puns and irony (believe me they were present). It was not so dissimilar to Eddie The Eagle or indeed Swimming With Men where sport was used for redemption and I sometimes even felt the influence of The Full Monty, where those crushed by life sought to rise up against the natural order, shouting I do matter!This movie was great because it went well beyond what the audience saw, it had a massive psychological backdrop, it had something to say about, dreams, family, teamwork, familial love, sacrifice, loneliness, redemption, community, disability and even the value of tough love.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Zak is older brother to Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh) they love wrestling they send the wrestling ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially, ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. and they got a call from WWE to come over to train with them like a audition but as in training wrestling. Dwayne Johnson doesn't play character he play's himself his not much in movie but he is in it for 1 scene just to give Saraya and Zak advice, then rest of movie he doesn't appear until in middle end of movie he is poster just to be their because he is Dwayne Johnson. the day when wrestlers met their couch (Vince Vaughn) Hutch Morgan witch he is tough couch like if you got passion of something like for explame wrestlers wanna be wrestlers in WWE he would be a let down guy he will be motivated you but in another way he is letting them down. after that Saraya adopts the name Paige from her favorite character on Charmed witch Rose McaGrown played Paige, that Saraya adds her name Paige for Stage name to WWE rather then using her real name she had another names like when Saraya was 18, competing under the ring name ""Britani Knight"", Saraya and her brother ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers whileworking toward their own promotion. she got chosen to be WWE out of all another guys because she explained about her life story rather then explaining because i was training it since i was kid it's my passion staff like that. after she got in she was begging for Hutch to be her brother in or else she won't join in WWE training but Hutch was being treat saying or else your out that was very tough choice she had to get herself so she does. after training Paige struggles with performing promos and Morgan's constant belittlement, later on she gets stronger and more motivated. she motivated wrestlers, It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements it's not full on drama their is but it's good mix up of combination like some of scenes are meant to be funny comedy then turns into drama witch i don't mind if this movie was like Wrestler (2009) Mickey Rourke. i never watched any of trailers at all because i wanted this to be cold turkey blind date watch of movie, i saw this in morning show news when they talk about movies. i thought this was drama film about family like if it's game plan or This Is Us short of thing but it's not it's true story about Wrestler page WWE witch i never knew about. Fans of WWE should be warned that even though the organization produced this the movie doesn't have the feel of it This is a very half British half American film. Dwayne Johnson delivers an enjoyable performance once again. The comic timing and chemistry between him and the other actors is worth watching. This movie definitely deserves more appreciation for its entertainment factor. It is funny and truly heartwarming. and also i liked women wrestlers i have loved female wrestlers it's how i got into women at age 4 i remember so on watching WWE i loved Melina. Paige is one of female wrestlers total divas i use to watch, also surprising i saw documentary at end of movie it's really good i enjoy look if your here for Paige if you love WWE if your not just fan just watch movie for interesting true story film. it's really worth of see 7.10.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,4,8.0,"Paige is easy to get behind as a character and while you're rooting for her all the way, I did like the fact that the movie also doesn't make her infallible. She's dismissive of the other women trying out because of their physical beauty and their former jobs. Surprisingly, I came down on the other women's side of the argument (how often does that happen?). I also appreciated that her training wasn't a walk in the park and how her separation from her brother deeply affected her confidence. They largely handle her ""fighting"" with her brother in a believable manner, its easy to understand him being jealous, as is her response to his selfishness. The Knight family dynamic is pretty realistic, they're dependent on each other and they're bond is deeply rooted in their shared love of wrestling. So I like how writer/director Stephen Merchant approached the story and these characters, it was done with some care even if the minute details were tweaked.Fighting with My Family boasts a capable cast of veterans who know how to make the most out of the material presented. Nick Frost, Vince Vaughn, Lena Headey and Dwayne Johnson have all been around the bend and are all beloved performers for various reasons. They all have some laugh out loud funny moments at different points in the movie and its a credit to both their performances and to writer/director Stephen Merchant to get the best stuff out of them (Vaughn isn't amazing but I haven't seen him be this consistently funny in a long time). But this movie belongs to Florence Pugh and her work is the key reason that Fighting With My Family works as well as it does. She does a good job in the ring (despite not being a trained wrestler) and she capably performs both the comedy and the drama. I had only previously seen her in Outlaw King (where she also shined in a thankless part) and I think she's got the chops to do whatever she sets her mind to in this business. I also liked the dynamic between her and her co-star Jack Lowden who plays her brother Zack Knight. Their relationship is the linchpin of the movie and you get her brother's regret and jealousy through Jack's performance.There was a time where I was a wrestling fan (not during the period this movie takes place) so I have a casual familiarity with the sport. I think the wrestling sequences are fairly well shot, there's nothing here that's going to take your breath away but there's some well represented scenes of fundamental wrestling that don't always get the attention. I also think the movie has good cinematography throughout, they walk a line where they show the not so fun side of this lives of this family without stopping the movie dead for you to wallow in their misery. It came across as authentic without being overbearing.When I think about genres that have the most familiar plot beats or the most repeated cliches, movies about sports have to be at the top or near the top of the list. When someone subverts them (for me Rush is a good example), you really take notice and Fighting with My Family just about gets around it. Through the dialogue, the jokes and the performances, its able to dodge and weave like a crusierweight fighting the world heavyweight champ. But in the last half hour, the heavyweight finally catches it in a hold and suplexes it back into the pile of cliches. I liked Paige and the Knight family as characters but this movie got pretty cheesy at the end of it. I had to hold back a couple of groans in Paige's final moments before her first match on Raw. It didn't wreck Fighting with My Family for me but it took a little of the shine off the belt. No movie based on a true story is factual and there is always dramatic licence but even my friend who I saw this with was able to point out the non-believable parts centred around Paige's wrestling and career and even she's far from a diehard fan. So while some parts of the movie are close to the story, its obvious where the movie isn't and its too bad.I think this is a fun and relatively unique biopic that balances well enough to get the job done. It doesn't reinvent the formula but it doesn't have to. The writing is sharp, the central performance is great and Fighting with My Family achieves what it what wants to achieve. It's not aiming for awards and its not geared toward the wrestling fanatics, its made for the general audience and to bring them into this world with a loving eye and a topical story (Paige is an underdog who helps bring legitimacy to the WWE Women's Division). I'm happy to recommend this to fans of the WWE, the uninitiated and the curious and to fans of the writer and the cast. I'd give Fighting with My Family a 7.5/10, rounding up to an 8/10.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",7,10,8.0,"I've been a passive fan of WWE for a while now. I don't watch all of it and what I do watch is sparse. During NXT's transformation from FCW and it's availability on the WWE Network, I was at my peak interest in watching it. NXT was better than any of the main RAW or Smackdown shows 100%. I was into how much fun NXT felt. CM Punk was the only main roster person I was really into, Daniel Bryan was fun to watch too . AJ Lee was great, but her competition was weak and seemed like they were all the ""models, cheerleaders, and dancers"" that Paige jokes about in this movie. But it wasn't until Paige came into the spotlight that my interest was peaked. I was into it for a while, then just lost interest all together.I saw this movie as I knew about Paige and was into the WWE during the time all this happened and even as a passive fan, this movie was extremely heartwarming and fun to watch. I knew a decent amount of the WWE side of things going on in the movie, but you don't need to be a fan of wrestling at all. It's just a fantastically done story about a family who has a passion for the entertainment sport like no other, and about their daughter having to leave to pursue a bigger version of their passion. Her brother struggles with not being chosen and coming to terms he won't make it as big as she does.Some of the facts are fudged here and there, but that happens in every bio-pic. Paige's NXT time seems to be glossed over a lot as she was in it for a while and in no way an ""unknown"" to wrestling fans. Also AJ Lee isn't given enough credit for what she did for women's wrestling, and the ending kind of makes it seem like Paige was the ONLY factor in legitimizing women's wresting in the WWE. But seeing how CM Punk, AJ, and WWE all fell out a few years back, it is understandable that they gloss over her impact on women's wrestling as this movie is a WWE product. Even then it is still a fantastically directed and made movie despite the WWE producing it.It's just an all around fun and heartwarming look into the world of wrestling.

But I didn't understand, this is about a family where mom, dad, brother, and sister are all wrestlers.It is based on the true story of a real British family. Florence Pugh (who I found so good in the 2016 Lady Macbeth) plays the lead character, Saraya Knight, who longed to get a break and get into the WWE as a featured wrestler. When she gets the chance she finds out it is harder than she ever imagined, including leaving her home and family behind to train in the USA.All of the first half-hour and much of the remainder is in England, as such it contains much of the uniqueness of British characters, British humor, and British mannerisms.

Even Vince Vaughn, usually the kiss of death for any film or TV series, puts in a solid, engaging performance.All this coming from someone who is not into WWE or wrestling at all.On the negative side, it does end feeling like just another Rocky remake.

Permalink",26,30,7.0,"Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paige's story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you don't really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy ""Fighting with My Family"". It's a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. It's has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zak's prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once she's over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in ""Little Drummer Girl"" last year. It's Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paige's journey isn't perhaps that extraordinary. She's way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. It's not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.""Fighting with My Family"" is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I can't imagine it's going to be anybody's favourite film of all time, it's a lot of fun to watch and I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but there's a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",80,98,7.0,"Had to double take on the director and writer and make sure if it was THE Stephen Merchant writing and directing this film and it turned out it was so that was interesting. I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.The film tells the story of Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.Florence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.The film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film.

This movie is based on a true story about a female wrestler and her wrestling family. Florence plays Saraya Knight, aka Paige. Nick & Lena are her parents, who had a traveling wrestling show in England that they performed in. The whole family wrestled including her 2 brothers-one was in prison for most of the movie for getting into fights-and there were even matches with the parents verses the kids. Vince plays the talent scout for the WWE, aka World Wrestling Entertainment, and when he announces on tv that there will be a new talent cattle call and all newcomers are welcome, Florence and her brother-the one that is not in prison-go for a try out. The movie is written & directed by Stephen Merchant, an actor that has a cameo in the film. There are several wrestling cameos as well. I'm not up on my wrestlers like I used to be but I did recognize Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and John Cena, and yes, The Rock is pretty much a cameo role-he has a couple of scenes-not like the previews make you think.

Permalink",18,22,6.0,"This is a very British working class comedy which centres around a wrestling mad family and their dreams of stardom. Its based on a true story and roughly around a documentary of the family made recently. At the helm is one of the writers of The Office, the superior UK version not the US remake. Also on board are a few American actors and Nick Frost from Spaced.
The tone of the movie is something like the commitments or Full Monty, you may need to be British to get some of the humour. Fortunately not all movies are made with the states in mind.
It is very funny however some of the language and scenes of violence may not make it suitable for smaller kids.
Also I have no interest or knowledge of wrestling but that didnt detract from the enjoyment of the movie.
This is not a mega-bucks The Rock vehicle, its a low key small budget UK flick with no real surprises but a few laughs along the way.
Its quite enjoyable.
Also the last thing, the reviewer know as ""thebricks"" used the final section of his review to call the UK a dump and suggest the people here just drink and fight which is highly offensive to us in the UK.
The fact that despite it being flagged twice for being offensive and off topic shows the mods do not seem to care about xenophobia. That being the case then I reckon the US is a dump full of obese low IQ xenophobes who don't understand anything outside of their own trailer park.

Permalink",4,4,7.0,"Written and directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is a fictional remake of a 2012 Channel 4 documentary of the same name. Without spoiling this unconventional funny heart breaking inspiration tale too much; the film about how Saraya Bevis (Florence Pugh) became wrestling superstar Paige was a bit jarring to watch with all the historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie simplified her pre WWE career to only working for her father's struggling promotion as always as Paige; when in truth, she work for many independents companies like Shimmer as Britani Knight. While I didn't mind that, I did think the movie could had shown that she was indeed unsuccessful in her first try out for WWE before getting the job later that same year. It would had add more to her comeback story and give hope to her brother Zak (Jack Lowden). Nevertheless, when she did signed her contract. She wasn't really assigned to NXT and its high tech performance center, but to then near dead developmental territory, FCW. It's here where she got the name Paige. Once again, I didn't really mind that, however the film kinda cop out by not showing any of her real cotemporaries. Don't get me wrong, I know that most of them are no longer in the company and that they can't use their likeness for the film. However, I really couldn't get with simpleton fictional character Jeri-Lynn (Kim Matula) when there is far more interesting and compelling side real-life individuals that they could had put into the film like Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch or Alexa Bliss. Just think of the stories, the movie could had with them. As for the lack of mention of her championships runs in NXT, it's alright as it build to her big win for the Divas belt from AJ Lee (Thea Trinidad) in the ending. However, that women championship is not that longstanding or well established as the film makes it out to be. In truth, it's a pretty pathetic title with a short heritage. So personally, the big win was not that interesting. While the movie did made the debut far more intense with fans jeering her and hard-hitting with actual match rather than a quick squash with audience already cheering. The fight was too clumsily put together. Plus, I kinda hate that Naomi and Tamina weren't there in the film to witness it. As for the performances. Trinidad was fine. She sound like AJ even if she didn't look like her due to Lee's trouble relationship with the company. As for producer Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson, he was fine, even if he somewhat hogged the spotlight. His presence in the film wasn't really needed. It was also nice to see cameos from other superstars even if they don't really look like that at the time. As for most of the quirkiest about Paige's family. It was well developed and delivered. Nick Frost and Lena Headey as the parents & the cameos of the real-life family members were fine even if her older half-sister didn't appear or mention in the film. However, Pugh as the lead role was a bit of a disappointment. Her acting was a bit off playing the wrestler a little too aversion. Not only that, but her appearance doesn't really match the real life Sayara. She is far too short and chubby. Also her wrestling skills were not really athletic. No wonder, why the filmmakers got Tessa Blachard to do most of the stunt work. Honestly, Tessa makes a more realistic Paige than Pugh. Better yet, why not have real-life Paige play herself. Nevertheless, the true star of the film has to go to Lowden as Zak. His dismissal sub plot about having to makes peace with himself, not making it to WWE was highly watchable & very compelling. However, unlike the real life guy who appearance and wrestling skills are average. This character had a pretty boy facial look, well tone body and amazing skills on the mat. So it doesn't make a lick of sense why he didn't get signed in the first place. At least, the original documentary show that Zak suffer from a knee injury preventing him from getting hired. As for Vince Vaughn as fictional composite trainer Hutch Morgan. He was fine. Yet, I just don't buy him as an ex-wrestler. I just wish, the movie establish more side coaches like Dusty Rhodes. It just seem odd for one man to be fully in charge of scouting, training and hiring for a global wrestling corporation without much help. Nevertheless, they did a good job of not featuring then head trainer Bill DeMott in this film, as he later resign amid accusations of abuse, misconduct and sexual harassment. That would be uncomfortable. However, it's a topic worth checking into the future. The same with showing the turbulent in her life since joining the company such as her drug suspended, her scandalous love, sex life being made public and her getting career ending injury. It would give the sequel if they make one, more depth as this movie felt a little simplified. Because of that, I felt like the film could end up being highly forgotten in the coming years like the Paige looking dishevel promo popular internet meme. This movie would get lose in the shuffle. In the end, while is Paige's house now. In a few years, it will be a house of cards. Nevertheless, this biopic has very good insight into how crazy professional wrestling really is. It offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes of WWE, and a rarer glimpse of what it takes just to get there. Even if some of the themes about overcoming adversity and hurdles has been done before in other scrappy underdog sport films. It's a step up from the other WWE Studios films. At least, we can be all on the same page about that.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",8,10,10.0,"Although Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson gets top billing in British writer & director Steven Merchants' amusing but insightful wrestling biography ""Fighting with My Family,"" he spends most of its 108 minutes off screen. In other words, if you're going to watch another of the Rock's conventional action thrillers, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Essentially, ""Fighting with My Family"" is the equivalent of a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), and Merchant chronicles the rise of a female British wrestler, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Outlaw King""), who had dreamed since age 13 about breaking into the WWE. In case you aren't familiar with the acronym, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., is what it means. Mind you, the WWE classifies their matches as dramatic because they amount to theatrical productions, with narrative-forged escapades orchestrated long before the talent tangle before multitudes. Approximately eight years ago, when Johnson was in the U.K., filming ""Fast & Furious 6,"" he saw a documentary about a Norwich-based family that held impromptu matches. He enjoyed it so much he contacted his ""Tooth Fairy"" co-star Steven Merchant about writing a screenplay about the Knight family's outrageous shenanigans. The patriarch of the Knight clan had wrestled professionally before he established a school for wrestlers that kept at-risk juveniles out of trouble.
As the title suggests, ""Fighting with My Family"" concerns a contentious, dysfunctional, working-class yarn about aspiring wrestlers. Nevertheless, this entertaining biopic isn't a generic, shallow account of the wrestling world that you'll forget once you've seen it. Indeed, this movie is all about female empowerment and the groundbreaking changes for women that Saraya Knight brought about as one of the youngest WWE Divas Champions. Merchant has created several sympathetic characters who experience change over time. Refusing to ridicule wrestling, Merchant has infused this factual story with as much blue-collar authenticity as if it had been made in the 196os, like the Albert Finney classic ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning."" The dialogue is literate; the performances endearing, and the humor is often subtle but never crude.
""Fighting with My Family"" concentrates on the exploits of our heroine, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Lady Macbeth""), who wasn't bitten by the wrestling bug until she turned thirteen and found herself substituting for an absent wrestler. Saraya's father, stout Ricky Knight (Nick Frost of ""Shawn of the Dead""), operates his own wrestling franchise in England. When Ricky isn't promoting tournaments, Ricky's second son Zak Knight (Jack Lowden of ""Dunkirk"") teaches at-risk adolescents, from public school to drop-outs, how to wrestle. Zak recruits all kinds, saving one teen from the misfortune of peddling contraband narcotics to lowlifes. Zak doesn't rate as much screen time as Saraya, but his impact on his sister's life is his prime contribution to the plot. Zak grew up watching the WWE. As a child, he could identify every wrestler strictly by their footwear. Obsessively, he had dreamed about wrestling in the WWE long before Saraya got converted. The WWE dispatches a gruff coach, Hutch (Vince Vaughn of ""Wedding Crashers""), to London in search of fresh blood. Saraya and Zak attend the audition with a carnival of other hopeful types in spandex. Tragically, Zak doesn't make the cut. Neither, for that matter, does anybody else, except his younger sister Saraya. Of course, she is stunned. Originally, she wanted to use the name Brittany, but the WWE already had a Brittany, so Saraya settles for Paige.
As Paige, Saraya dresses like a Goth girl: black apparel, black hair, with dark raccoon eyes. Later, during her first official bout, Paige encounters a defending champion who teases her appearance about her Halloween costume. Initially, Saraya refused to make the flight to train in Florida unless Zac came along, but Hutch refused to add her brother. Predictably, Hutch's decision crushes Zac. By all rights, Zac seemed like a shoo-in with his experience and demeanor. Over the ensuing 45 minutes, Zac struggles with the demise of his dream, momentarily careening off the rails himself in a bar fight until his older brother, Roy Knight (James Burrows of 2010's ""Robin Hood""), straightens him out. It seems Zak is a natural born teacher who inspires his students. Once Zak realizes his destiny lies with his family and the next generation of wrestlers that he can develop, he sheds his anxiety about his failure to make the WWE.
Meanwhile, Paige discovers training in sunny, faraway Florida is no picnic. She has to negotiate tough obstacle courses and flip over huge tractor tires to either shape up or ship out. At first, she alienates herself and dismisses a quartet of bimbo-like babes with golden California tans and statuesque figures. Paige's mother, Julia (Lena Headey of ""Dredd""), warns her daughter about such creatures who use their bodies to mesmerize audiences with their physical endowments. Paige dismisses them as if they were prostitutes, until she realizes that she has not only misjudged them but also herself. Hutch hovers over his recruits like a boot camp drill instructor. Constantly, he taunts them when they find the going desperate to take the easy way out and quit. Throughout these antics, Paige struggles to fit in with her cohorts, eventually dying her mane blond and spraying on a golden tan. Ultimately, it doesn't take long for our heroine to realize she cannot be somebody she isn't.
As Saraya's father Ricky, Nick Frost plays a supporting role in this cheeky comedy, but his presence makes an unforgettable impression. Wearing a shock of hair like a Mohawk Indian, Ricky is a motor-mouthed, down-to-earth, fellow. One of his best bits occurs when he auditions an aspiring wrestler who must withstand a direct blow to the face with a garbage can lid. Frost is contagiously hilarious, but he occasionally turns serious when Saraya isn't sure about her future in wrestling. The ensemble cast generates convincing charisma, and Saraya/Paige emerges triumphant despite her underdog status. ""Fighting with My Family"" qualifies as a memorable domestic melodrama as well as a first-rate wrestling masterpiece.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",39,60,8.0,"Another day, another chance to review a movie, and this morning's review is an interesting film that held much potential to be fun and unique. Sports movies seem to be the theme of this week, though this film certainly is not the typical approach to a typical sport that is portrayed in the film. Robbie K here to take a look at the British comedy about an American sports venue that continues to rake in the dough of Wrestling, and the hidden world that you might not know involved in the theatrical event. Let's get started as I take a look at:Movie: Fighting With My Family (2019)Director:
Stephen Merchant
Writer:
Stephen Merchant
Stars:
Dwayne Johnson, Lena Headey, Vince Vaughn
LIKES:Funny
Deeper Story
Training Montages
Casting
Good Utilization of Extras
Good Pace
UniqueSUMMARY:Fighting With My Family may not be the typical comedy given a lot of approaches with this movie, but my friend and I both did enjoy the comedy that was presented. It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements that I had not expected from the trailers. Character development, major themes of family, friendship, dedication, and many other subplots actually work well to provide an engaging film that isn't quite the norm for this genre. In addition, it reveals the hard work that goes into becoming a wrestler, and how physically/emotionally demanding the application process can be in something that many do not even pass a look at.
The cast certainly does the job of bringing the tale to life with Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden crushing their performances with characters that drive much of the movie, the former in particular being the central pillar to base everything around. Yet secondary characters played by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn are utilized so well that they not only avoid overshadowing, but really mesh well with the main performers. Even the tertiary characters have some good involvement in the film, showing that you can utilize the cast well and tell a very good story, even with a super celebrity in the mix. Needless to repeat, but will anyway, this film utilizes its actors very well, crafting a family component. And it is all done with a pace that is entertaining to watch, not being too caught up in the drama to be slow, and yet still going slow enough to tell much of the story. Certainly this is a unique concept, but also a unique example of how a movie can be done.DISLIKES:The Inclusion of the Extra brother
The Rapid Development of Character Relationships at Times
The Rapid Story jumps at times.
Dramatization Vs. Facts
Semi Predictable
SUMMARY:Finding dislikes for me was a little harder than I anticipated, but here are few parts of the story that were a little off my element. While the characters were done well, the extra brother that got brought in I don't think was utilized as well. Yes, he has his place, but compared to some of the other characters, his arc had some drama and potential, but then kind of fizzled out compared to what I thought they were going to do. In addition, the movie surprisingly made some good character relationships, but then progressed them a little too quickly. I was hoping that there would be a little more time with tending to the flourishing relationship they were starting to build. This is primarily during the wrestling training period where things go from zero to 100% in a relatively short amount of time, and while still good I wanted more development with them in terms of that story arc. And because of trying to fit the tale in the shorter amount of time, the movie, especially near the end led to some hasty jumps that just as things were starting to develop were quickly transitioned to the next phase. Again, I would have liked a little more fleshed out conclusions and integrations, but it certainly is not as short sheeted as some other films have done.
In regards to the dramatization, well it works to add that Hollywood magic to jazz up stories, but I do understand that those who know Paige's story might want more fact than fiction. I can't really say I know the story, but the movie works well to blend the structures with that Hollywood magic to make it entertaining. If you are fans of the story of the youngest Diva though, then brace yourself for some potential divergence. In regards to the rest of the tale, the semi predictable plot is something else difficult to ignore, though again, the rest of the movie sort of offsets this component so it's only a minor area of improvement.
The VERDICT:Surprisingly, the movie worked much better than what I was expecting from the trailers. It's balanced on many levels, telling an entertaining story, with multiple levels than the typical comedy brings to you. With great use of characters/actors, comedy that is a bit diversified, and a pace that brings the wrestling world to life, you have a fantastic film to get lost into. Yet, there are still a few other components still in need of more time than anything else, to take those components they were building and strengthen them further. I enjoyed this film a lot to warrant a trip to the theater, but can understand if you want to reserve your trips to the more special effect frenzy that other films have going for it. Definitely look for it at home though.My scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 8.5

Permalink",10,13,8.0,"I love movies that open my mind up to a world that I was not previously accustomed to. The world of professional wrestling has never once appealed to me. A staged ""sport"" where grown men in tights throw each other around to compete for a ""title belt""? Yeah, no, not for me. But if there's anything I've learned over years of seeing hundreds of movies in theaters, you have to keep your mind open. Fighting with My Family is not only a huge delight and surprise, but one that did slightly peak my interest in at least giving wrestling a shot. Anchored by the producing presence of The Rock and even acting in a few scenes, Stephen Merchant carefully crafts the story of a family of wrestlers who have dreams of making it big, only for one of their children to win a shot at the WWE over the other. Florence Pugh plays ""Paige"", the real life WWE Champion who worked her way up the WWE to become the youngest champion at age 21. Pugh, who was brilliant in The Outlaw King, gives Paige a snarky but extremely charming edge. There's no doubt in my mind, Pugh has the makings of a future Oscar winner. While the film itself likely won't win any awards, it's the definition of a crowd-pleaser.8.6/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",6,7,9.0,"I recently saw 'Ford v Ferrari' and hated every minute of it. I thought I hated every minute of it because I have a passionate dislike for motor racing. 'Fighting with My Family' is proof that that was not the case, because I also despise wrestling, yet loved this film. I couldn't believe how invested I found myself. I genuinely cared not just about the characters, but the wrestling outcome as well. If you'd told me I'd feel that way going into this movie I would've laughed in your face. Stephen Merchant is a genius.Back when Merchant and Ricky Gervais were working together Gervais was given the majority of the credit for their brilliant work. I have always maintained though that it was Merchant who was the true architect behind the brilliance, because what Gervais has achieved since Merchant left has been pitiful by comparison. Merchant's biggest strength is his structuring. He perfectly paces his films, gives every character the ideal amount of time to shine, and keeps the audience invested throughout. Then add in the fact that the man is hilarious and you have a perfect package. He is the most under-rated filmmaker working today.The cast in this movie is incredible too. Florence Pugh finishes off her almost perfect 2019. She is the glue that holds this film together. Vince Vaughan gets a role perfectly suited for him and nails it. I love it when he is given free reign to be as sarcastic as possible. He may just be the best in the business at that. Finally, Nick Frost is again in terrific form. He's hilarious and also immensely charming all at once. You can't help but love him.This movie is a comedy at its heart, but let me tell you it moved me a lot more than most out and out dramas manage to. Add to that how inspirational it is and you are left with an incredibly good film. I can't recommend this one highly enough.

Permalink",7,9,7.0,"Like all good 'sports' (or 'activity') movies, 'Fighting With My Family (2019)' cuts to the heart of its story and appeals to all audiences, whether or not they're fans of its focal pastime. In this case, that pastime is wrestling, which I have a passing knowledge of but no real deep affinity for - or, indeed, understanding of. Yet, this flick had me gripped, even during the purely in-ring segments. It follows a familiar 'rags to riches' story but sprinkles, unsurprisingly, a hefty dose of family drama on there, too. It's characters are crafted to be likeable, believable and flawed. They're given a fair bit to overcome, which is why it's all the more satisfying whenever they do so. The stakes are also slightly unconventional, usually being more internal than is customary with the genre. The comedy, while sometimes fairly broad, frequently puts a smile on your face and often makes you chuckle. It adds to the overall entertainment value of a piece that isn't afraid to veer into slightly darker territory. The narrative itself is clean and constantly forward-moving. The only real issue is the somewhat rushed finale, which makes the protagonist's shift from 'time to train' to 'this is your big shot' seem incredibly - and unbelievably - quick. It's not a huge issue, though, and the finish itself is satisfying, mainly because Merchant wisely chooses to hold his cards closer to his chest here. All of this makes for a winning formula: a feel-good, self-professed 'Rocky (1976)'-esque, funny yet heartfelt tale which might not be all that unique but earns its emotional beats and ultimate outcome pretty much twofold. 7/10",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",6,7,6.0,"""Fighting with My Family"" looks into the comical yet inspiring journey of Saraya 'Paige"" Bevis who climbs out of her family's independent promotion in Norwich, England to become a WWE superstar. She would become a trailblazer for today's women superstars who are known for their equally competitive edge as the men and not treated like sex objects like they were in the ""Attitude Era"" and the ""Ruthless Aggression Era"". Although the focus of the the story is based on Paige's incredible climb to the top of a major wrestling company like the WWE, it's still feels like director/writer Stephen Merchant is taking this simplified tale in the formulaic direction of a sports underdog story of an individual who has to go against the odds to reach her fullest potential and has to work through those speed bumps in order to get there. Even though WWE CEO Vince McMahon is not listed in the credits of producers, the self-promoting of this billion dollar company is so frequent, it can also be quite monotonous at times. It's like as though it wants to continually endorse its promotion like no other promotions matters.The movie follows a similar path to ""Rocky"" as we watch Saraya (Florence Pugh) break free from the shackles of her hometown in Norwich, England before taking on the persona of her Gothic-themed character Paige and challenges herself as legitimate superstar in the WWE. Even though it's a sincere biopic, Merchant does make this film dependent on funny quips and hilarious one-liners to provide a little laughter for the tough road ahead of her. The cliched tropes that come in the story are in full force. We have the tough, but fair coach Hutch Morgan (played with humour and charm by Vince Vaughn). There is musical montage that comes into full effect while she's training. And then there's the climactic battle in the ring that is supposed to be attention-grabber. And sure it lists Paige's triumphs quite nicely, they tend to forget or skim through the hardships and scandals she's faced over the years. Such things like the failed drug tests that temporarily got her fired from WWE, her estranged relationship with former WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio, the leaked sex video, and the botched wrestling move by Sasha Banks that resulted in ending her wrestling career at only 24 years old. Everything depicted in this film seems like her journey was too immaculately displayed and seems so unnaturally happy-go-lucky that everything just comes at her without repercussions.It always helps to get viewers in watching ""Fighting with My Family"" is mainly due the trailer that is mostly displayed by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and his selling the product directly at us. With his charismatic catchphrases and his poetic diatribes, this will surely get viewers to see this movie. Even though he has creative control serving as an executive producer, he's role is generally just a glorified cameo. The main performer in this movie is Florence Pugh as the aforementioned Paige who transformed the wrestling ring to ""her house"". Pugh has shown some strong performances in her young career in movies like ""Lady McBeth"" and ""Little Drummer Girl"". Backing her up are veteran performers like Lena Headey as her mother Julia and comic actor Nick Frost who starred in another Merchant movie ""Hot Fuzz"" as her father Ricky. Vince Vaughn shows one of his stronger performances in a long time as tough coach Hutch Morgan and Jack Lowden gives the more dramatic sides to the story as Saraya's brother Zack who's jealousy and depression for failing to make the cut had an affect on his family and most of all himself.The opening scenes in which the emphasis is on the the dynamics of Paige and her family of traveling wrestlers who run a promotion in her native Norwich, England. Her family is obsessed with wrestling and as the youngest and the only daughter, she has to prove herself even harder that she can accomplish bigger things in life. Her father, an ex-con, after several years of doing jobs he can't keep, found his calling running wrestling tours where his family are main attraction. He also runs a training school for wrestlers to build their strength and character and his son Zack teaches. The opening scenes are as real as they are hilarious, by the film starts to fizzle once Paige gets chosen to wrestle for NXT in hopes to be on the main roster to be a part of either two WWE weekly branded shows, RAW or Smackdown. The sibling squabbles are believable as Zack feels his world was crushed when he didn't get signed and it leads to him falling in a state of depression. It's too bad that this dramatic side of the story is just an afterthought that should have been fleshed out more. Paige's sage advice to her brother about believing in yourself and being proud of the skin you own seems like it was recited out of an old self-confident manual.And though the movie as a whole is likable, it can at times be formulaic and way too squeaky clean at times. Pugh delivers the best performance as WWE superstar Paige, the comical elements in the story can be too frequent and leaves the dramatic stuff way too underdeveloped. WWE's banter is fully protected that it heavily relies on its product placement, even though it great that they acknowledge that wrestling is predetermined, they do seems to spare the details. Also in Paige's first match it feels like it was unscripted, but I have plenty of reasons to doubt. Like this sport itself, it may make you think it's all real only to realize not everything in the world of sports entertainment appears like you'd expect.",Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,3,6.0,"A different type of WWE film that should please hardcore fans and newbies alike, Fighting with My Family may not knock it out of the ring but this fun, heartfelt and enjoyable true life tale is sure to bring a smile to viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Curiously directed by Office co-creator and awkward British comedian extraordinaire Stephen Merchant, Family sees the wrestling conglomerate steer away from dodgy actioners and movies starring c-grade actors to shine a light on the inspiring story of English WWE import Saraya Knight aka Paige, who took the industry by storm thanks to her fierce determination and steely resolve to make it in the cutthroat industry that chops and changes its roster on a more than frequent basis.Filled with a loaded cast that includes supporting turns from Vince Vaughan as hard as nails but caring wrestling coach Hutch, Nick Frost and Lena Heady as Knight's wrestle mad parents and a cameo from superstar (and this film's producer) Dwayne Johnson, Family is perhaps most notable moving forward as the moment its leading lady Florence Pugh officially announced herself as a leading lady of note.So good already in her breakout turn in the little seen but well regarded Lady Macbeth, the memorable TV miniseries The Little Drummer Girl and currently riding a wave of success due to her turn in buzzy horror Midsommar, there's little doubt that Pugh is quickly becoming one of the next big things in the industry and her committed turn here as Knight is a joy to behold.Perfectly balancing the act of being confident yet flawed and also self-doubtful as well as likeable and very funny, Merchant and Pugh ensure Family rides off the back of Knight and Pugh is more than up for the challenge as she turns from small time family oriented wrestler to a girl removed from her creature comforts and thrown into a world full of fakes and bloodsuckers.There are absolutely zero surprises in the journey Merchant takes us on in Family's runtime and there is a sense that everyone is made to be far too clean cut (such as how awesomely nice The Rock is) for this to be considered a true to life retelling of events but the core of the story remains enjoyable throughout and it's a credit to all that this wrestling focused dramedy is such an easy watch.Final Say -Sure to delight WWE fans of all ages and casually entertaining for the rest of us, Fighting with My Family is as generic as they come but thanks to its real life subject matter and Pugh's wickedly fun central performance, this is a film well worth tapping into.3 free hot dogs out of 5",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",3,3,8.0,"The WWE is one of the most dominating entertainment companies in the world today. What began as a small territorial wrestling promotion has developed into the largest wrestling promotion in the world. Not only do they handle championship wrestling on a near nightly basis they've moved into movies as well. If you don't believe that look at the career of Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock. But movies that tell the life stories of wrestlers aren't that common. That changes with FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY.In 2002 young Zak and Saraya Knight argue over what to watch, a WWF pay per view or CHARMED. While wrestling in the living room to decide their parents, Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia (Lena Headey), come in and rather than stop the fight correct their holds. Ricky is a wrestler and promoter of his own promotion. As the children grow they work in the ring alongside their parents with Zak (Jack Lowden) dreaming of the day he can join the WWE. Sister Saraya (Florence Pugh) dreams of being their alongside her older sibling.An opportunity presents itself when the WWE is set for a show in the UK. Zak and Saraya show up to try out under the watchful eye of Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughan). Since they already have a Britani in the WWE Saraya must change her name and choose Paige after one of the characters from CHARMED. Things run smooth and the pair think they stand a good chance of getting in. But it is only Saraya that is chosen. When she refuses to go without Zak he convinces her that this is the dream the family has had for years and she agrees.Saraya now Paige shows up in Florida for the WWE's NXT promotion, a lower level wrestling promotion that grooms wrestlers for the main event in the WWE. She's not like the other female wrestlers, nearly all leggy blonde models. But at 18 she's young and ready to go and has more in the ring experience than any of them combined.Being different, being the odd one out, Paige doesn't make friends and it isn't long before her disdain for their abilities shows causing more conflict within the group. Hutch pushes her, seeing something there that many would not.Back home Zak has hit rock bottom. A new father and husband, his dreams crushed, watching his sister's star rise he's torn between family loyalty and jealousy over her chance at success. Ricky and Julia aren't much better seeing Paige's rise not as something that she herself wanted but more what they wanted for themselves when they were younger as well as her being able to help promote their own business now.As the grind gets to her Paige begins to wonder if this is what she's meant for. Are the dreams of being a WWE champion really hers or are they the dreams her family wanted? Can she handle not just the physical aspects of being a professional wrestler but the emotional ones as well?The movie is one of the most entertaining flicks I've seen this year. I was truly surprised by it. Not only did it tell the real life story of a WWE star (well as real as any biopic can be) but it did it with heart as well. You don't have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this movie (though it probably helps). More than anything though I found myself laughing out loud (yes really!) more than once while watching the film. It delivers on so many levels. Superficial, probably but always entertaining.All actors here do a fantastic job of bringing what could have been cardboard cutout figures to life. Their hopes and dream can be felt, their goals achieved and crushed bring joy and pain and each one of them ties into the other to make this a movie not just about the star but the entire family. Not an easy task to achieve and yet they do.WWE stars like Dwayne Johnson, The Miz, Sheamus and Big Show also make appearances in the film and Johnson was also one of the producers for the film.

Permalink",10,15,9.0,"This docu-drama follows the incredible story of WWE superstar Paige, or Raya Knight (Florence Pugh). Born into a cheerful wrestling family, Raya and her brother Zak (Jack Lowden) get a once in a lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE. Raya earns the spot, with Zak being left behind, and Raya having to leave her family behind to compete for the spot as Diva. With rigorous coach Hutch (Vince Vaughn), Raya will be pushed to new limits while Zak faces a test moving on from his dreams. These journeys push them to fight for their family and prove what truly makes a star.Florence Pugh becomes Raya Knight/Paige with her persistence and wit towards any obstacle being very inspirational. She respectfully adapts Paige and her final speech at WrestleMania looks exactly like its real-life counterpart. Jack Lowden does the same with Zak, my favorite character, as his character arc is so relatable with his struggles to move past his dreams of making the WWE, disregarding his own wife and child. Jack shows excellent range presenting Zak's eventual passion for helping others with his family's wrestling service and taking care of his child. Nick Frost and Lena Headey, as Ricky and Julia Knight, complete the family with their uniquely jovial, but lewd attitudes that only want the best for their children and other people in need. Vince Vaughn, as Hutch, is very impressive providing an inspirational mentor for Raya, as well in his real-life friendship with the Rock. Dwayne Johnson plays himself, enough said. In all seriousness, it is very entertaining and informative to watch his real-life impact on Paige.Stephen Merchant spectacularly writes and directs, with the events presented in clear chronological order. But the real standout comes from his snappy writing, as all the jokes and emotional moments land. He truly knows how to write human and relatable characters. My favorite scene is when The Rock gives Raya's family a surprise call. Dwayne Johnson and Nick Frost truly give their all in the funniest repartee, while also giving the feels with The Rock presenting his admiration and best regards for Raya. Still, with all the positives, I feel that the film doesn't acknowledge all angles to a boxing match and the matches here feel very simplistic at times. However, the film's main intent is to flesh out the family first and then get into the nuances of the sport, so this flaw isn't particularly egregious.The message of this film is that a person's character doesn't come from the title they hold, but by one's contribution to help others. Zak holds the strongest example of this. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 due to language and sexual references.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Permalink",47,56,6.0,Not fully aware of paige and her families history and due to that i may have fewer things i dislike about it. The movie was pretty good for a casual fan you will obviously know some things were added to make it more interesting although a little bit more effort could have been added. Zelina Vega in no way represented AJ Lee from her look our even attire which i felt they may have gotten lazy on. Overall pretty decent movie felt a bit rushed and like some info was left out but was a nice attempt at putting a biopic of sorts together on a person who doesnt have extended history and a long list of memorable events in her career. I think a few other female superstars could have shined better with something like this but for what it was worth it was watchable.,Warning: Spoilers,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",9,13,8.0,"For a lot of kids and even adults, wrestling, especially WWE wrestling is the closest thing to watching real life superheroes and titans clashing. Sure, we all know it's a show and the callouts and insults are a part of it, but the smack downs and falls make everything look real and given the physique of the wrestlers, they still put in a lot of time to play the part and give us a circus of sweat and bruises. I don't follow it as much as I did as a child, but I have a lot of respect for the sport and show.Most of us know Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, Triple H, Big Show, John Cena, and the Rock. These are guys who've managed to create memorable characters that are almost as big as comic book heroes. But it's interesting to see what made them want to be wrestlers and how they managed to beat out other hopefuls. One such story not only focuses on the youngest woman to enter the WWE, but her family who are all die hard wrestling fans. That story is portrayed in Fighting with My Family.In the early 2010s, two English amateur wrestlers Rick (played by Nick Frost) and Julia (played by Lena Headey) and their children Zak (played by Jack Lowden) and Saraya (Played by Florence Pugh) not only love the sport, but even showcase their own matches and organize an after school practice. They also have dreams of having Zak and Saraya becoming a part of the WWE circuit with constant tapes sent in. One day when a SmackDown event is happening in London, they get a tryout with many hopefuls with WWE trainer Hutch Morgan (played by Vince Vaughn). Saraya, now gping by Paige, is selected, but her brother isn't.Paige flies to Florida for training camp, where she sticks out like a sore thumb, due to her looks and small frame. She also feels self-conscience as the other women selected look like super models. She's having trouble adapting to the WWE standards and training, and to top it off, still feels bad that her brother wasn't taken. Zac himself turns to alcohol and her parents start to make merchandise of their daughter's upcoming success. With a lot at her and moving really fast, she starts to understand that perhaps, wrestling is much more real then anticipated.Fighting with My Family does take a lot from other sports movies like the underdog plot, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm okay with that as this is really good. This movie made me realize that not only are a lot of women sports not focused on enough, but even more so in the WWE. Paige's story is not only inspiring, but the family she comes from is a lot of fun. The family's time needed to be shown in order to come out a little different from other sport movies.I really want to know what kind of training Florence Pugh went through, as I thought she was great. You really feel for her and her dilemma that she wants to be famous, but is afraid if she moves forward, then her family will be left behind. We all want to help our families, but it's understandable that things will get in the way as one climbs up the ladder. What's really going to help this movie's age is her family, who is one of the most unique families on film. They are trashy and have few manners, but they all care for each other and seems to want to help other kids that want that confidence. .One of the weaker points of the movie is Vince Vaughn. He's does fine in his part, but even with his no nonsense attitude, I still mostly saw him and not a character. I thought it was because of the actor, but I realized he was phenomenal in Hacksaw Ridge. Another problem is the pacing of the end which does show her progression after training, but it felt rushed compared to the slower first half. Perhaps there's more to the movie that was cut, but I think a little more time could have shown Paige the dilemma of suddenly being a star.I'll give this eight pictures of the real Paige out of ten. Something tells me that a lot of people, especially families, are going to like Fighting with My Family. Even if some accuse the movie as an ad for WWE, then so be it; it's like complaining that the use of the NFL in a biopic makes it an advertisement. It's a slam and worth watching.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",21,33,9.0,"Fighting with my family directed by Stephen Merchant (writer for TV show The Office)is based on a true story. The Knight family has dad Ricky Knight(actor Nick Frost), mom Julia Knight (Lena Headey) , son Zak Knight and daughter Saraya Knight (actress Florence Pugh) . The whole family loves to wrestle . Saraya and Zak compete for the same WWE and coach Hutch (acted well by Vince Vaughn ends up choosing only Saraya whose new name is Paige. Paige has to leave England and home alone and go to Florida to compete with other wrestlers. Most notable competitors are 3 pretty American blondes. Paige feels very out of place but manages to shine with help of love , strength, faith in her from her family. Brother Zak , initially envious of his sister's success, gets over his insecurities . Paige has a great relationship with her brother and forces him to enjoy his girlfriend and their cute little newborn. Zak realizes his strengths and respects Paige's strengths. With the whole family backing her, Paige is victorious. Even though i do not watch wrestling /WWE this movie was very pleasant and likeable. Knight family put aside their unsophisticated ways when they have to meet Zak's girlfriend's sophisticated parents. The scenes are done well and Dwayne Johnson ""The Rock"" is very pleasant . Paige learned to wrestle while fighting with family. Paige is very level headed and actress Florence Pugh was very convincing as Paige. Jack Lowden as Zak was very convincing in showing his emotions of hurt and then great at turning his jealousy into tolerance and acceptance. The whole cast did a great job. It was nice to see actress Kim Matula as 1 of the 3 blondes ( Hope from my favorite soap Bold & Beautiful) on the big screen. Very enjoyable movie with a take home message.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",2,2,,"Fighting with My Family chronicles the life & career of professional wrestler Paige who grew up in a wrestling fanatic family in Norwich, England that's fully devoted to sports entertainment business. The plot covers her journey from being selected for tryouts to moving to America where she trains & learns the skills of the trade, and culminates with her historic debut on Monday Night Raw.Directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is one hilarious ride but it also packs a lot of heart. The family may seem idiosyncratic but their bonding with each other has a genuine vibe to it. Add to that, it does a neat job of depicting the rite of passage every aspiring wrestler has to go through and shows that just like any other sport, it requires nothing less than blood, toil, tears & sweat to make it to the big stage.Florence Pugh plays the role of Saraya ""Paige"" Knight and delivers an outstanding performance by aptly articulating her emotions. Jack Lowden is in as her brother and shows his downhill journey with a balanced input. Nick Frost & Lena Headey portray Paige's parents and appear to be thoroughly enjoying their roles. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gets back into his old skin with ease. And Vince Vaughn chips in with solid work in the role of a WWE trainer.Overall, Fighting with My Family is a well crafted, finely narrated & wonderfully performed sports comedy that's amusing, entertaining & moving in sufficient doses. Delivering the goods with plenty of heart, it may be nostalgic to some & inspiring to others but it is by all means a welcome & heartfelt tribute to all the wrestlers who continue to put their bodies on line week after week just for the sake of entertaining us. A time well-spent, Fighting with My Family is worth a shot.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",2,2,8.0,"I am not a wrestling fan. I was once. I can remember a time growing up when Wrestlemania was tantamount to the Super Bowl. But times change and we grow into some things and out of others. I'd lost interest in it prior to Paige ever coming to the spotlight and had taken the stance of, ""its fake, it's bogus, I don't know how I ever watched it.""All this to say how shocked I was to watch this and LOVE it. Fighting With My Family is a marvelously funny, touching and emotional story of a girl passionate about something and struggling to achieve it. The characters are all rich and nuanced and I feel like we learn the exact right amount about each of them. It's based on a true story and, while some of the details are changed, as is often the case, the broader strokes are all pretty accurate.Florence Pugh is remarkable here. It's crazy to me to think that I've seen her now in Midsommar and Little Women and yet this is what makes me finally fall in love with her. She is exceptional here and her emotional triumph is so powerful I actually got a little choked up myself by it even when I knew what was coming. Nick Frost, as always, is a welcomed sight, as was the Rock, birth of whom were wonderful. Jack Lowden as the brother has wonderfully portrayed conflict and internal strife.The only real downside to me is that this is horribly formulaic. It follows the underdog's triumphant success story outline to the letter. At no point does it surprise me or throw a curveball to make me second guess anything. Once it starts, you know the track you're on and it never once diverted from that.That's my only negative though. This really was an exceptional watch and given its readily available to stream on both Prime and Hulu, there's no real reason not to give it a shot.",,Fighting with My Family,"Biography,Comedy,Drama",7.1,2019,0,108.0,86793,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I was shocked by how much I liked it given that this movie was also produced by WWE (although I'm sure it has more to do with the Rock's production company than theirs); it's not like they are known for producing high quality movies.
I knew a little bit about Paige's (Saraya Jade Bevis) back story from watching WWE programming and reading up on her history but was still surprised by many parts eg. parents backstory. I knew that she came from a family of wrestlers but I didn't know how much the Rock influenced her career or even the phone call. I can't imagine a more cool moment for her family and for her.

This film was never going to top the first two, becasue they are a product of their time, and you can never re-create that, but Bill & Ted Face The Music is a decent enough send off for the characters.It is a bit sad though that it is just ""ok"". The film does have a certain cheapness to its look and feel, and Keanu was sounding a bit tired if I'm honest. It retreads some ground, but not as much as you would think, and there are genuine laughs in here for sure. Dean Parisot's directing is solid, but a bit lacklustre in places, and I think they should have got Peter Hewitt back from Bogus Journey. It's not awful by any means, but I think it lacks a bit of magic (which was probably the 80s/90s).A special mention must go to Alex Winter who does a great job here. He IS Bill S. Preston, and he has his old mannerisms down to a tee which was very familiar and very comforting.In a way, the film made me a bit sad. Bogus Journey tied up the story quite well, but there was always a bit of the door open to do more if they wanted, and now that it's done it was a kind of uneventful. 1994-ish would have been a perfect time to do a third film, because as upsetting as it is, Bill and Ted with all their ""Wows"" and ""Dudes"", are The past.However, they are MY past, and from MY generation, so I was very happy to see them once last time, and despite all the nitpciks, I had fun with the film.All that's left to say is the best message in any film ever:Be excellent to each other...... and party on!!!",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Bill and Ted were a comedic surfer dude stereotype. The girls take it a step further. They don't just take some mannerisms from their dads they are like a satirical sketch of their dads and it was hard to watch. They could have just been normal or said ""dude/most excellent"" etc without the whole weird body poses etc.On top of that remember bill and Ted used to wear stuff that wasn't that strange or out there for their time periods. They wear super 80s stuff in the 80s and super 90s stuff in the 90s and now they again wear very period appropriate regular clothing. The daughters on the other hand wear these super strange outfits. Esp the short black haired girl was wearing this incredibly weird tight top thing that just looked so stupid and out there.Anyway. So I'm no ""man's rights activist"". In fact o hate those people..but MAN did they try hard to basically remove bill and Ted from the movie and make it as female centric as possible. Before you dislike, hear me out.1. Bill and Ted the leads of the movies are shown as utter failures and versions of then are even worse. Alcoholic, liars, thieves and inmates etc. Even their best versions suck, can't make any good music etc2. They have two daughters who from the start look like they are being set up to take the franchise over. It really looks like the writers / creators would preferably just not use Bill and Ted at all and continue the story with their daughters3. Great ones are now all female.4. Rufus is dead and his daughter now continues his work while his wife has become the great one.5. Ling Lun is a female in the movie (supposed to be male)6. Greatest drummer ever? A black cave woman who makes monkey sounds.*Not only did they turn Ling Lun into a female, which is culturally insensitive. They made a black woman into an ape like cave woman that jumps around like an animal and makes weird faces and monkey noises. How is that acceptable?7. Daughters unlike their dads (who have always been shown as rather daft) are geniuses who understand quantum physics and can write the most brilliant song ever without knowing how to play any instruments etc.*I legit thought the rapper was made up / fake but apparently kid cudi is a real person. And accordihg to the movie he understands quantum physics. WHY? I googled him.hoping he'd have some degree in real life that would justify it, but no. The first thing that came up is that this guy called Jaden Smith ""the chosen one"". I'm sorry but no one with anything over 1/5th of a regular human brain would say that unironically. Why not have an actual intelligent / genius black dude in the movie? It's not like they don't exist and there are far smarter (and better) rappers too. Also, the rapper is station? What? At least it would explain why he is so smart but then again they are using a real life rapper.8. The (male) robot is also an incredible failure. So is Ted's dad9. It's the daughters that manage to convince Death to join the band while B&T fail.10. The daughters are the ones that write the song and save the universe in the end. Bill and Ted are ""there for them"" and ""part of their band"".That doesn't make any sense! And I'm not looking for too much logic in a movie like this, but this is the dumbest (and most predictable) plot twist I've ever seen. If that's the case why does the future worship B&T? Why do they listen to B&Ts music and talk about their song etc? Why not a single reference to their daughters?Also the song SUCKED like it was so bad. It wasn't even really rock even though we heard rock in the future (previous movies). And everyone is supposed to play an instrument. You'd think the song would sound like a giant orchestra but it sounds like some computer generated electronic song with some electric guitar mixed in.To whoever makes these movies. It's OK to make a movie about two (white) dudes. You don't have to shoehorn in female cast members etc or try to turn every movie about a bunch of dudes into a movie about a bunch of dudettes. I'm sure many if not most women also don't care about shoehorned in women. Instead of ruining movies that happen to have male leads with efforts to shoehorn in women, write a good movie with women leads.As a minority I see what Hollywood is doing as well intentioned but it's so damn stupid. Like the virus song that gal gaddot did etc. STOP. Just make good movies. Stop with the forced characters and gender,ethnicity changes etc. Instead make good newmovies about women and minorities etc.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",181,291,3.0,"This is a movie that didn't need to be made.While the opening scene was amusing, the rest of the movie was little more than a mashup of the first two movies. As a story it adds very little to the mythos and storyline of Bill and Ted, and quite frankly had more to do with their daughters (which is really no surprise).Brigette Lundy-Paine actually did a remarkable job emulating the mannerisms of Keanu Reeves 25 years ago, but there just was no real chemistry between her and Samara Weaving, The ending of the film was basically just a rehashing of the ending of the second film where they did the thing and all the world unites (again) in harmony and song, with a maguffin device straight out of Doctor Who.With the original(s) there was at least a sense of growth and maturation with Bill and Ted, overcoming an obstacle. In this, things happened, and then more things happened, and no one was really better or worse for it -- things just happened. Sadly, Hollywood is just bent on regurgitating everything that was delightful and fun 20 years ago, and is dragging everything kicking and screaming into the present. Many were saying this, myself included, that Bill and Ted, like Wayne and Garth, Jay and Silent Bob, Randal and Dante, Han and Chewie, exist in a time that is no longer, and there is no real place for them as they were back then today -- let them stay in the past, so we can build on the legacy for tomorrow.Movies like Bill and Ted are locked in time, and today it just doesn't translate well. There was something interesting about Socrates, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, and Beethoven that fit the narrative well: What would these historical figures think of San Dimas California in the then present time?In this you just have an assortment of random, name dropped historical figures, Mozart, Hendrix, Louie Armstrong, some cave man on drums, Kid Cudi and a Chinese Flute Player, all who are just there for no real rhyme or reason, more so because they came up on an algorithm generated by Spotify or Apple Music based on ""your personal likes"".For the most part, I found the story and the film to be lacking in any real substance (and this is comparing it to the not at all serious, light hearted BaT:EA and BaT:BJ), or point. It was just... there, and then it was done. It adds nothing new or interesting, and really doesn't have to be watched at all.

Permalink",215,323,5.0,"I loved Bill & Ted! I watched the movies, cartoon, started saying 'dude' and bogus because of it, and hoped that this would be a nostalgic look back to my early teens. And it kind of was, in a way. And there was a sweetness in watching Bill&Ted again fumble their way to saving the world/universe/reality.But the problems with B&T are the usual problems with most remarks and sequels coming out of Hollywood.* I'm definitely for equality, but the males (with backstory) in the film are either dysfunctional or complete idiots while the women come to save the day because they're portrayed as smarter and more resourceful. Spread the cluelessness around, and spread the resourcefulness around.* (Future) Bill&Ted were even painted as being manipulative and nasty in some parts, which is not who they were in the original films.* the daughters bring everyone together in the end and are credited with creating THE SONG. But neither plays an instrument and just offer some feedback on what each musician was attempting to do. So they don't really have any talent other than telling seasoned and talented musicians what to do (cause the daughters listened to lots of music and therefore know better then them I suppose). If they are to be the heroes then they really should have had stronger parts written for them.
Hollywood, if you're going for strong female leads in a film then give the female lead a backstory, with skills that justify them being in that role. No-one deserves a leading role just because they fit a particular demographic.* the music. What can I say other than there was soooo much more they could have done with this. The music in B&T was build around the time period they were in. Metal & rock were cool at the time so the original films can be placed in a time period. This one however... it's almost like they didn't have a clear idea of what they wanted to portray.* I have to say I like Bill's daughter and how she tried to go full Bill/Keanu. She nailed a lot of his idiosyncratic movements and facial expression. Ted's daughter though could have been played by anyone. So this missed the beat for me. Either make sure the daughters are girl versions of the Dads, give them their own personalities&mannerisms, or even swap them (Ted's daughter behaves like Bill and vice versa). Unfortunately we got half of one of these.There are more, but other reviewers have covered these points.Finally, I just want to say that it's sad that the film missed the point of Bill&Ted - it was never about saving the world, or their marriages. They were just 2 sweet dudes, a little clueless, trying to do what they thought was right in their own way. And we like seeing their positivity come through even when times were rough. And because they were always positive things worked out in the end, sometimes with a little help from Rufus.There was a glimmer of that here, but not enough.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I wish I'd seen the movie they saw, because this one was pretty bad.There are a few good things in Face the Music. The plot is a typically intricate B&T time-loop paradox, as the protagonists travel forward in time in search of their masterpiece while their carbon-copy daughters travel backwards in search of help, leading to a surprisingly clever but completely ridiculous finale. And Brigette Lundy-Paine is wonderful as Billie, perfectly capturing Keanu Reeve's physicality.On the other hand, during the entire movie there were only 4 or 5 times when I actually laughed.

Permalink",15,22,7.0,"Bill Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) are still struggling to write their epic song. They have broken up with Death (William Sadler). They start couples counselling with the Princesses. Rufus' daughter Kelly (Kristen Schaal) arrives from the future with a dire warning. Space and time is unraveling. They need to write the song right away to save existence. Their daughters Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) try to help by assembling the greatest band ever.I still love the boys. Alex Winter is the same guy, just 30 years older. Keanu is no longer that dude. They should probably try to write to his present day personality. The main takeaway is that they're still good friends and that's the most important part for this movie. My favorite section is the counselling and that section says it all about them. As for the princesses, I accept that they would be different actresses. I do wonder if they could play that up by turning into something completely different. Why not insert different multiple sets of princesses into the movie? Why not use their real life better-half? Instead, they are just a bit younger which is another different and not a fun one. They are now about a decade younger than the guys. My favorite side character remains Death. He just makes me laugh and it's disappointing that he doesn't show up until the second half of the movie. My least favorite new character has to be the killer robot. He's no Station. If he's to redo Death, it would be better to just use Death for that plot device. Maybe the future could trick Death into hunting Bill & Ted for revenge which can be solve again in a game challenge. I like the daughters for the most part. They're pretty good Lil' Bill & Ted. Their quest is a rehash of the first movie. I don't really like the prophecy since it's obvious what the reveal will be. At the end of the day, this is the Bill & Ted franchise. It's not going to make logical sense. The Scooby gang will always remain the best of friends.

Permalink",20,36,4.0,"I saw the original Bill & Ted movies on their original releases. Clearly, I'm a lot older now, and sadly, so are Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter, and their dumb teen routine really isn't befitting of two men in their fifties. To try and get around this, the writers of Face The Music introduce us to the guys' twenty-four-year-old daughters Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and Thea (Samara Weaving, who thankfully isn't called upon to scream at any point); unfortunately, neither actress is very good in their role, and laughs are few and far between.Like their fathers in the first film, Billie and Thea travel through time collecting historical figures: in this case, famous musicians to form a band that will help Bill & Ted to record the song that will save reality and unite all of mankind. Meanwhile, their dads also travel through time, trying to acquire the very same song from their future selves, which leads to several scenes featuring different incarnations of our heroes, Reeves and Winter wearing heavy makeup to play musclebound convicts and pensioners. Following Bill and Ted is a robot called Dennis who has been sent from the future, Terminator-style, to kill the hapless pals for not fulfilling their destiny.This time-twisting plot has plenty of potential for zaniness, but the script fails to make the most of the insanity. Even a visit to Hell to meet their old pal Death (William Sadler) fails to tickle the ribs.One of the film's biggest problems is that none of the historical characters are involved in anything very memorable. In the first film, Napolean went to a water park and ate the Ziggy Pig ice cream, and Joan of Arc led an exercise class at a mall while Genghis Khan trashed a sports shop. It was a lot of fun. In Face The Music, Jimi Hendrix, Mozart, and Louis Armstrong are given nothing of interest to do. Joining in the tedium are a fictional prehistoric drummer, an ancient Chinese flute player I've never heard of (there to appeal to the Chinese market?), and a rapper called Kid Cudi whose presence will seriously date this film in a few years (I'd never heard of him either).The finale, in which the Billie and Thea turn out to be the saviours of reality by leading the band while their dads issue musical instruments to everyone who ever existed (?!?!), is confusing and rushed, and, more importantly, extremely bogus since a) it's not Bill & Ted who unite humanity after all, and b) the music at the end is not very good.

Permalink",113,205,3.0,"Loved the originals, I didn't expect this to be good, and I'm so glad we didn't pay to see it because I would've been peeved. There are a couple of jokes in the beginning that were funny, but it fizzles out thereafter. There's no real plot here, the characters have no depth, it's not like they did in the original movies but there weren't so many of them thrown together in one film that it made it feel chaotic and disengaging. Mostly I felt like there wasn't any cohesion whatsoever, it felt as though the script was thrown together in a single night and rushed into production to satisfy fans. The biggest let down is the music, the music is awful. How do you have Dave Grohl cameo and not play? I just don't understand that. Instead we get Kid Cuddi pumping up the crowd (he doesn't sing, which I'm thankful for, but then why is he even there?). Part of what made the Bill and Ted franchise appealing to fans was that it occurred when metal was at it's height, instead of trying to appeal to those same fans, who probably still listen to metal, they instead tried to amalgamate every music genre in the world to appeal to everyone, and it comes off as just that, a hot mess of musical genres. Coupled with a poor script and two actors who look less than enthused to reprise their roles, this film isn't worth rewatching.",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",271,401,7.0,"It's ""ok"".That's all you really need to know. It's ok, and it does its job. This film was never going to top the first two, becasue they are a product of their time, and you can never re-create that, but Bill & Ted Face The Music is a decent enough send off for the characters.It is a bit sad though that it is just ""ok"". The film does have a certain cheapness to its look and feel, and Keanu was sounding a bit tired if I'm honest. It retreads some ground, but not as much as you would think, and there are genuine laughs in here for sure. Dean Parisot's directing is solid, but a bit lacklustre in places, and I think they should have got Peter Hewitt back from Bogus Journey. It's not awful by any means, but I think it lacks a bit of magic (which was probably the 80s/90s).A special mention must go to Alex Winter who does a great job here. He IS Bill S. Preston, and he has his old mannerisms down to a tee which was very familiar and very comforting.In a way, the film made me a bit sad. Bogus Journey tied up the story quite well, but there was always a bit of the door open to do more if they wanted, and now that it's done it was a kind of uneventful. 1994-ish would have been a perfect time to do a third film, because as upsetting as it is, Bill and Ted with all their ""Wows"" and ""Dudes"", are The past.However, they are MY past, and from MY generation, so I was very happy to see them once last time, and despite all the nitpciks, I had fun with the film.All that's left to say is the best message in any film ever:Be excellent to each other...... and party on!!!",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",372,560,3.0,"So first off. It was very very predictable from the start that the two daughters would end up ""saving the day"".The daughters are super cringe worthy. Bill and Ted were a comedic surfer dude stereotype. The girls take it a step further. They don't just take some mannerisms from their dads they are like a satirical sketch of their dads and it was hard to watch. They could have just been normal or said ""dude/most excellent"" etc without the whole weird body poses etc.On top of that remember bill and Ted used to wear stuff that wasn't that strange or out there for their time periods. They wear super 80s stuff in the 80s and super 90s stuff in the 90s and now they again wear very period appropriate regular clothing. The daughters on the other hand wear these super strange outfits. Esp the short black haired girl was wearing this incredibly weird tight top thing that just looked so stupid and out there.Anyway. So I'm no ""man's rights activist"". In fact o hate those people..but MAN did they try hard to basically remove bill and Ted from the movie and make it as female centric as possible. Before you dislike, hear me out.1. Bill and Ted the leads of the movies are shown as utter failures and versions of then are even worse. Alcoholic, liars, thieves and inmates etc. Even their best versions suck, can't make any good music etc2. They have two daughters who from the start look like they are being set up to take the franchise over. It really looks like the writers / creators would preferably just not use Bill and Ted at all and continue the story with their daughters3. Great ones are now all female.4. Rufus is dead and his daughter now continues his work while his wife has become the great one.5. Ling Lun is a female in the movie (supposed to be male)6. Greatest drummer ever? A black cave woman who makes monkey sounds.*Not only did they turn Ling Lun into a female, which is culturally insensitive. They made a black woman into an ape like cave woman that jumps around like an animal and makes weird faces and monkey noises. How is that acceptable?7. Daughters unlike their dads (who have always been shown as rather daft) are geniuses who understand quantum physics and can write the most brilliant song ever without knowing how to play any instruments etc.*I legit thought the rapper was made up / fake but apparently kid cudi is a real person. And accordihg to the movie he understands quantum physics. WHY? I googled him.hoping he'd have some degree in real life that would justify it, but no. The first thing that came up is that this guy called Jaden Smith ""the chosen one"". I'm sorry but no one with anything over 1/5th of a regular human brain would say that unironically. Why not have an actual intelligent / genius black dude in the movie? It's not like they don't exist and there are far smarter (and better) rappers too. Also, the rapper is station? What? At least it would explain why he is so smart but then again they are using a real life rapper.8. The (male) robot is also an incredible failure. So is Ted's dad9. It's the daughters that manage to convince Death to join the band while B&T fail.10. The daughters are the ones that write the song and save the universe in the end. Bill and Ted are ""there for them"" and ""part of their band"".That doesn't make any sense! And I'm not looking for too much logic in a movie like this, but this is the dumbest (and most predictable) plot twist I've ever seen. If that's the case why does the future worship B&T? Why do they listen to B&Ts music and talk about their song etc? Why not a single reference to their daughters?Also the song SUCKED like it was so bad. It wasn't even really rock even though we heard rock in the future (previous movies). And everyone is supposed to play an instrument. You'd think the song would sound like a giant orchestra but it sounds like some computer generated electronic song with some electric guitar mixed in.To whoever makes these movies. It's OK to make a movie about two (white) dudes. You don't have to shoehorn in female cast members etc or try to turn every movie about a bunch of dudes into a movie about a bunch of dudettes. I'm sure many if not most women also don't care about shoehorned in women. Instead of ruining movies that happen to have male leads with efforts to shoehorn in women, write a good movie with women leads.As a minority I see what Hollywood is doing as well intentioned but it's so damn stupid. Like the virus song that gal gaddot did etc. STOP. Just make good movies. Stop with the forced characters and gender,ethnicity changes etc. Instead make good newmovies about women and minorities etc.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",181,291,3.0,"This is a movie that didn't need to be made.While the opening scene was amusing, the rest of the movie was little more than a mashup of the first two movies. As a story it adds very little to the mythos and storyline of Bill and Ted, and quite frankly had more to do with their daughters (which is really no surprise).Brigette Lundy-Paine actually did a remarkable job emulating the mannerisms of Keanu Reeves 25 years ago, but there just was no real chemistry between her and Samara Weaving, The ending of the film was basically just a rehashing of the ending of the second film where they did the thing and all the world unites (again) in harmony and song, with a maguffin device straight out of Doctor Who.With the original(s) there was at least a sense of growth and maturation with Bill and Ted, overcoming an obstacle. In this, things happened, and then more things happened, and no one was really better or worse for it -- things just happened. Sadly, Hollywood is just bent on regurgitating everything that was delightful and fun 20 years ago, and is dragging everything kicking and screaming into the present. Many were saying this, myself included, that Bill and Ted, like Wayne and Garth, Jay and Silent Bob, Randal and Dante, Han and Chewie, exist in a time that is no longer, and there is no real place for them as they were back then today -- let them stay in the past, so we can build on the legacy for tomorrow.Movies like Bill and Ted are locked in time, and today it just doesn't translate well. There was something interesting about Socrates, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, and Beethoven that fit the narrative well: What would these historical figures think of San Dimas California in the then present time?In this you just have an assortment of random, name dropped historical figures, Mozart, Hendrix, Louie Armstrong, some cave man on drums, Kid Cudi and a Chinese Flute Player, all who are just there for no real rhyme or reason, more so because they came up on an algorithm generated by Spotify or Apple Music based on ""your personal likes"".For the most part, I found the story and the film to be lacking in any real substance (and this is comparing it to the not at all serious, light hearted BaT:EA and BaT:BJ), or point. It was just... there, and then it was done. It adds nothing new or interesting, and really doesn't have to be watched at all.

Permalink",215,323,5.0,"I loved Bill & Ted! I watched the movies, cartoon, started saying 'dude' and bogus because of it, and hoped that this would be a nostalgic look back to my early teens. And it kind of was, in a way. And there was a sweetness in watching Bill&Ted again fumble their way to saving the world/universe/reality.But the problems with B&T are the usual problems with most remarks and sequels coming out of Hollywood.* I'm definitely for equality, but the males (with backstory) in the film are either dysfunctional or complete idiots while the women come to save the day because they're portrayed as smarter and more resourceful. Spread the cluelessness around, and spread the resourcefulness around.* (Future) Bill&Ted were even painted as being manipulative and nasty in some parts, which is not who they were in the original films.* the daughters bring everyone together in the end and are credited with creating THE SONG. But neither plays an instrument and just offer some feedback on what each musician was attempting to do. So they don't really have any talent other than telling seasoned and talented musicians what to do (cause the daughters listened to lots of music and therefore know better then them I suppose). If they are to be the heroes then they really should have had stronger parts written for them.
Hollywood, if you're going for strong female leads in a film then give the female lead a backstory, with skills that justify them being in that role. No-one deserves a leading role just because they fit a particular demographic.* the music. What can I say other than there was soooo much more they could have done with this. The music in B&T was build around the time period they were in. Metal & rock were cool at the time so the original films can be placed in a time period. This one however... it's almost like they didn't have a clear idea of what they wanted to portray.* I have to say I like Bill's daughter and how she tried to go full Bill/Keanu. She nailed a lot of his idiosyncratic movements and facial expression. Ted's daughter though could have been played by anyone. So this missed the beat for me. Either make sure the daughters are girl versions of the Dads, give them their own personalities&mannerisms, or even swap them (Ted's daughter behaves like Bill and vice versa). Unfortunately we got half of one of these.There are more, but other reviewers have covered these points.Finally, I just want to say that it's sad that the film missed the point of Bill&Ted - it was never about saving the world, or their marriages. They were just 2 sweet dudes, a little clueless, trying to do what they thought was right in their own way. And we like seeing their positivity come through even when times were rough. And because they were always positive things worked out in the end, sometimes with a little help from Rufus.There was a glimmer of that here, but not enough.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I wish I'd seen the movie they saw, because this one was pretty bad.There are a few good things in Face the Music. The plot is a typically intricate B&T time-loop paradox, as the protagonists travel forward in time in search of their masterpiece while their carbon-copy daughters travel backwards in search of help, leading to a surprisingly clever but completely ridiculous finale. And Brigette Lundy-Paine is wonderful as Billie, perfectly capturing Keanu Reeve's physicality.On the other hand, during the entire movie there were only 4 or 5 times when I actually laughed. Not belly laughs, just little ones. The movie is simply not funny. I'm not even sure it's *trying* to be funny.At one point in the movie Dave Groh came up and I asked my girlfriend, ""who's Dave Groh."" She said for her that question was the funniest thing that happened during the movie.Face the Music is kind of likable and a little sweet, and the story kept me generally engaged.

Permalink",15,22,7.0,"Bill Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) are still struggling to write their epic song. They have broken up with Death (William Sadler). They start couples counselling with the Princesses. Rufus' daughter Kelly (Kristen Schaal) arrives from the future with a dire warning. Space and time is unraveling. They need to write the song right away to save existence. Their daughters Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) try to help by assembling the greatest band ever.I still love the boys. Alex Winter is the same guy, just 30 years older. Keanu is no longer that dude. They should probably try to write to his present day personality. The main takeaway is that they're still good friends and that's the most important part for this movie. My favorite section is the counselling and that section says it all about them. As for the princesses, I accept that they would be different actresses. I do wonder if they could play that up by turning into something completely different. Why not insert different multiple sets of princesses into the movie? Why not use their real life better-half? Instead, they are just a bit younger which is another different and not a fun one. They are now about a decade younger than the guys. My favorite side character remains Death. He just makes me laugh and it's disappointing that he doesn't show up until the second half of the movie. My least favorite new character has to be the killer robot. He's no Station. If he's to redo Death, it would be better to just use Death for that plot device. Maybe the future could trick Death into hunting Bill & Ted for revenge which can be solve again in a game challenge. I like the daughters for the most part. They're pretty good Lil' Bill & Ted. Their quest is a rehash of the first movie. I don't really like the prophecy since it's obvious what the reveal will be. At the end of the day, this is the Bill & Ted franchise. It's not going to make logical sense. The Scooby gang will always remain the best of friends. The big goal is hokey and mostly light non-sense. There is a lightweight joy to this franchise which this movie is able to maintain.

It's hard to watch him struggle through it. Same kind of applies to Keanu. He really shows his age here, hard to believe he was 24 or 25 in the first movie and he was playing a teenager? Now he's 55 and still trying to act like one. How has he not changed, mentally?Most ridiculous is Hal Jordan, Keanu's dad, still working as a cop at almost 80 years old?

Permalink",20,36,4.0,"I saw the original Bill & Ted movies on their original releases. Clearly, I'm a lot older now, and sadly, so are Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter, and their dumb teen routine really isn't befitting of two men in their fifties. To try and get around this, the writers of Face The Music introduce us to the guys' twenty-four-year-old daughters Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and Thea (Samara Weaving, who thankfully isn't called upon to scream at any point); unfortunately, neither actress is very good in their role, and laughs are few and far between.Like their fathers in the first film, Billie and Thea travel through time collecting historical figures: in this case, famous musicians to form a band that will help Bill & Ted to record the song that will save reality and unite all of mankind. Meanwhile, their dads also travel through time, trying to acquire the very same song from their future selves, which leads to several scenes featuring different incarnations of our heroes, Reeves and Winter wearing heavy makeup to play musclebound convicts and pensioners. Following Bill and Ted is a robot called Dennis who has been sent from the future, Terminator-style, to kill the hapless pals for not fulfilling their destiny.This time-twisting plot has plenty of potential for zaniness, but the script fails to make the most of the insanity. Even a visit to Hell to meet their old pal Death (William Sadler) fails to tickle the ribs.One of the film's biggest problems is that none of the historical characters are involved in anything very memorable. In the first film, Napolean went to a water park and ate the Ziggy Pig ice cream, and Joan of Arc led an exercise class at a mall while Genghis Khan trashed a sports shop. It was a lot of fun. In Face The Music, Jimi Hendrix, Mozart, and Louis Armstrong are given nothing of interest to do. Joining in the tedium are a fictional prehistoric drummer, an ancient Chinese flute player I've never heard of (there to appeal to the Chinese market?), and a rapper called Kid Cudi whose presence will seriously date this film in a few years (I'd never heard of him either).The finale, in which the Billie and Thea turn out to be the saviours of reality by leading the band while their dads issue musical instruments to everyone who ever existed (?!?!), is confusing and rushed, and, more importantly, extremely bogus since a) it's not Bill & Ted who unite humanity after all, and b) the music at the end is not very good.

There are a couple of jokes in the beginning that were funny, but it fizzles out thereafter. There's no real plot here, the characters have no depth, it's not like they did in the original movies but there weren't so many of them thrown together in one film that it made it feel chaotic and disengaging. Mostly I felt like there wasn't any cohesion whatsoever, it felt as though the script was thrown together in a single night and rushed into production to satisfy fans. The biggest let down is the music, the music is awful. How do you have Dave Grohl cameo and not play? I just don't understand that. Instead we get Kid Cuddi pumping up the crowd (he doesn't sing, which I'm thankful for, but then why is he even there?). Part of what made the Bill and Ted franchise appealing to fans was that it occurred when metal was at it's height, instead of trying to appeal to those same fans, who probably still listen to metal, they instead tried to amalgamate every music genre in the world to appeal to everyone, and it comes off as just that, a hot mess of musical genres.

If you're happy to see both Bill and Ted together trying to recapture the attitude they had in the first two movies, they sort of half-succeed at doing it, despite feeling a little awkward at them being way older now. There are some good jokes that land, but its pretty much close to impossible to recreate the magic of the first two films if you ask me. It's definitely my least favourite of the three.That being said, Face the Music is a very easy watch and does have cool references that old fans will appreciate and notice. I wasn't the biggest fan of their daughter characters taking up almost the same amount of screentime as Bill and Ted personally, so whenever it was just them two it kind of lost me for a few minutes with them trying so hard to act like Bill and Ted. I did like the new robot character though and of course seeing old characters reappear and take part again. Make no mistake, this movie does aim for nostalgia and familiar story beats, but you know what it was an alright sequel that could have been way, way worse like Dumb and Dumber To. This at least stayed true to the tone and characters.6/10",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",100,200,10.0,"The whole family hopped in the convertible and went down to the drive-in tonight to see the Bill and Ted threequel on opening night. We are all fans of the first two. My daughter asked if I thought it was gonna be any good, cuz the trailers didn't inspire and we were really disappointed with Kevin Smith's recent Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. I told her I honestly didn't care because after 25+ years I felt it was a personal love letter from the cast to me and I was gonna return the love.IT WAS GREAT! Everything you can want in a Bill and Ted movie. Every bit as good as the first one and definitely better than the weaker second installment. I always enjoyed the second one but it suffered with low budget effects that couldn't do the story justice.FYI there's a great end credits scene.SPOILERS.
The movie starts and our two lovable BFF's are still tied at the hip to the point their wives take them to couples counseling but BIll and Ted think it's for both couples at the same time. They've had some success with their music but it's been a while since the glory days and things haven't panned out the way good old Rufus prophesized. They're living the typical middle class life in the burbs with the house and one daughter each. Now with the deadline coming for them to unite the world, all time and space is falling apart. In typical Bill and Ted fashion they decide to steal their music from their future selves (and in typical B & T logic you can't really 'steal' from yourself anyway). They meetup with several future versions of themselves only to find each one STILL hasn't written the universe altering music and each successive reunion (see what I did there?) playing for good laughs. Their daughters go on a separate adventure to unite the worlds greatest backup-band consisting of a slew of history's greatest musicians.It ends the only way a B & T movie can, with a rock show.It could be the perfect ending to the series but does it have to be?

This movie is the third in the Bill & Ted series with 29 years since the last one, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, and 31 years since the first one, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure-That's 1989 & 1991 respectively for those of you that are not real good in math.

In his absence, Kristen Schaal plays George's daughter. Keanu & Alex are now middle_aged men with wives and daughters but still have not wrote the song that is supposed to unite the world.

This film was never going to top the first two, becasue they are a product of their time, and you can never re-create that, but Bill & Ted Face The Music is a decent enough send off for the characters.It is a bit sad though that it is just ""ok"". The film does have a certain cheapness to its look and feel, and Keanu was sounding a bit tired if I'm honest. It retreads some ground, but not as much as you would think, and there are genuine laughs in here for sure. Dean Parisot's directing is solid, but a bit lacklustre in places, and I think they should have got Peter Hewitt back from Bogus Journey. It's not awful by any means, but I think it lacks a bit of magic (which was probably the 80s/90s).A special mention must go to Alex Winter who does a great job here. He IS Bill S. Preston, and he has his old mannerisms down to a tee which was very familiar and very comforting.In a way, the film made me a bit sad. Bogus Journey tied up the story quite well, but there was always a bit of the door open to do more if they wanted, and now that it's done it was a kind of uneventful. 1994-ish would have been a perfect time to do a third film, because as upsetting as it is, Bill and Ted with all their ""Wows"" and ""Dudes"", are The past.However, they are MY past, and from MY generation, so I was very happy to see them once last time, and despite all the nitpciks, I had fun with the film.All that's left to say is the best message in any film ever:Be excellent to each other...... and party on!!!",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",372,560,3.0,"So first off. It was very very predictable from the start that the two daughters would end up ""saving the day"".The daughters are super cringe worthy. Bill and Ted were a comedic surfer dude stereotype. The girls take it a step further. They don't just take some mannerisms from their dads they are like a satirical sketch of their dads and it was hard to watch. They could have just been normal or said ""dude/most excellent"" etc without the whole weird body poses etc.On top of that remember bill and Ted used to wear stuff that wasn't that strange or out there for their time periods. They wear super 80s stuff in the 80s and super 90s stuff in the 90s and now they again wear very period appropriate regular clothing. The daughters on the other hand wear these super strange outfits. Esp the short black haired girl was wearing this incredibly weird tight top thing that just looked so stupid and out there.Anyway. So I'm no ""man's rights activist"". In fact o hate those people..but MAN did they try hard to basically remove bill and Ted from the movie and make it as female centric as possible. Before you dislike, hear me out.1. Bill and Ted the leads of the movies are shown as utter failures and versions of then are even worse. Alcoholic, liars, thieves and inmates etc. Even their best versions suck, can't make any good music etc2. They have two daughters who from the start look like they are being set up to take the franchise over. It really looks like the writers / creators would preferably just not use Bill and Ted at all and continue the story with their daughters3. Great ones are now all female.4. Rufus is dead and his daughter now continues his work while his wife has become the great one.5. Ling Lun is a female in the movie (supposed to be male)6. Greatest drummer ever? A black cave woman who makes monkey sounds.*Not only did they turn Ling Lun into a female, which is culturally insensitive. They made a black woman into an ape like cave woman that jumps around like an animal and makes weird faces and monkey noises. How is that acceptable?7. Daughters unlike their dads (who have always been shown as rather daft) are geniuses who understand quantum physics and can write the most brilliant song ever without knowing how to play any instruments etc.*I legit thought the rapper was made up / fake but apparently kid cudi is a real person. And accordihg to the movie he understands quantum physics. WHY? I googled him.hoping he'd have some degree in real life that would justify it, but no. The first thing that came up is that this guy called Jaden Smith ""the chosen one"". I'm sorry but no one with anything over 1/5th of a regular human brain would say that unironically. Why not have an actual intelligent / genius black dude in the movie? It's not like they don't exist and there are far smarter (and better) rappers too. Also, the rapper is station? What? At least it would explain why he is so smart but then again they are using a real life rapper.8. The (male) robot is also an incredible failure. So is Ted's dad9. It's the daughters that manage to convince Death to join the band while B&T fail.10. The daughters are the ones that write the song and save the universe in the end. Bill and Ted are ""there for them"" and ""part of their band"".That doesn't make any sense! And I'm not looking for too much logic in a movie like this, but this is the dumbest (and most predictable) plot twist I've ever seen. If that's the case why does the future worship B&T? Why do they listen to B&Ts music and talk about their song etc? Why not a single reference to their daughters?Also the song SUCKED like it was so bad. It wasn't even really rock even though we heard rock in the future (previous movies). And everyone is supposed to play an instrument. You'd think the song would sound like a giant orchestra but it sounds like some computer generated electronic song with some electric guitar mixed in.To whoever makes these movies. It's OK to make a movie about two (white) dudes. You don't have to shoehorn in female cast members etc or try to turn every movie about a bunch of dudes into a movie about a bunch of dudettes. I'm sure many if not most women also don't care about shoehorned in women. Instead of ruining movies that happen to have male leads with efforts to shoehorn in women, write a good movie with women leads.As a minority I see what Hollywood is doing as well intentioned but it's so damn stupid. Like the virus song that gal gaddot did etc. STOP. Just make good movies. Stop with the forced characters and gender,ethnicity changes etc. Instead make good newmovies about women and minorities etc.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",181,291,3.0,"This is a movie that didn't need to be made.While the opening scene was amusing, the rest of the movie was little more than a mashup of the first two movies. As a story it adds very little to the mythos and storyline of Bill and Ted, and quite frankly had more to do with their daughters (which is really no surprise).Brigette Lundy-Paine actually did a remarkable job emulating the mannerisms of Keanu Reeves 25 years ago, but there just was no real chemistry between her and Samara Weaving, The ending of the film was basically just a rehashing of the ending of the second film where they did the thing and all the world unites (again) in harmony and song, with a maguffin device straight out of Doctor Who.With the original(s) there was at least a sense of growth and maturation with Bill and Ted, overcoming an obstacle. In this, things happened, and then more things happened, and no one was really better or worse for it -- things just happened. Sadly, Hollywood is just bent on regurgitating everything that was delightful and fun 20 years ago, and is dragging everything kicking and screaming into the present. Many were saying this, myself included, that Bill and Ted, like Wayne and Garth, Jay and Silent Bob, Randal and Dante, Han and Chewie, exist in a time that is no longer, and there is no real place for them as they were back then today -- let them stay in the past, so we can build on the legacy for tomorrow.Movies like Bill and Ted are locked in time, and today it just doesn't translate well. There was something interesting about Socrates, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, and Beethoven that fit the narrative well: What would these historical figures think of San Dimas California in the then present time?In this you just have an assortment of random, name dropped historical figures, Mozart, Hendrix, Louie Armstrong, some cave man on drums, Kid Cudi and a Chinese Flute Player, all who are just there for no real rhyme or reason, more so because they came up on an algorithm generated by Spotify or Apple Music based on ""your personal likes"".For the most part, I found the story and the film to be lacking in any real substance (and this is comparing it to the not at all serious, light hearted BaT:EA and BaT:BJ), or point. It was just... there, and then it was done. It adds nothing new or interesting, and really doesn't have to be watched at all.

Permalink",215,323,5.0,"I loved Bill & Ted! I watched the movies, cartoon, started saying 'dude' and bogus because of it, and hoped that this would be a nostalgic look back to my early teens. And it kind of was, in a way. And there was a sweetness in watching Bill&Ted again fumble their way to saving the world/universe/reality.But the problems with B&T are the usual problems with most remarks and sequels coming out of Hollywood.* I'm definitely for equality, but the males (with backstory) in the film are either dysfunctional or complete idiots while the women come to save the day because they're portrayed as smarter and more resourceful. Spread the cluelessness around, and spread the resourcefulness around.* (Future) Bill&Ted were even painted as being manipulative and nasty in some parts, which is not who they were in the original films.* the daughters bring everyone together in the end and are credited with creating THE SONG. But neither plays an instrument and just offer some feedback on what each musician was attempting to do. So they don't really have any talent other than telling seasoned and talented musicians what to do (cause the daughters listened to lots of music and therefore know better then them I suppose). If they are to be the heroes then they really should have had stronger parts written for them.
Hollywood, if you're going for strong female leads in a film then give the female lead a backstory, with skills that justify them being in that role. No-one deserves a leading role just because they fit a particular demographic.* the music. What can I say other than there was soooo much more they could have done with this. The music in B&T was build around the time period they were in. Metal & rock were cool at the time so the original films can be placed in a time period. This one however... it's almost like they didn't have a clear idea of what they wanted to portray.* I have to say I like Bill's daughter and how she tried to go full Bill/Keanu. She nailed a lot of his idiosyncratic movements and facial expression. Ted's daughter though could have been played by anyone. So this missed the beat for me. Either make sure the daughters are girl versions of the Dads, give them their own personalities&mannerisms, or even swap them (Ted's daughter behaves like Bill and vice versa). Unfortunately we got half of one of these.There are more, but other reviewers have covered these points.Finally, I just want to say that it's sad that the film missed the point of Bill&Ted - it was never about saving the world, or their marriages. They were just 2 sweet dudes, a little clueless, trying to do what they thought was right in their own way. And we like seeing their positivity come through even when times were rough. And because they were always positive things worked out in the end, sometimes with a little help from Rufus.There was a glimmer of that here, but not enough.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I wish I'd seen the movie they saw, because this one was pretty bad.There are a few good things in Face the Music. The plot is a typically intricate B&T time-loop paradox, as the protagonists travel forward in time in search of their masterpiece while their carbon-copy daughters travel backwards in search of help, leading to a surprisingly clever but completely ridiculous finale. And Brigette Lundy-Paine is wonderful as Billie, perfectly capturing Keanu Reeve's physicality.On the other hand, during the entire movie there were only 4 or 5 times when I actually laughed.

Permalink",15,22,7.0,"Bill Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) are still struggling to write their epic song. They have broken up with Death (William Sadler). They start couples counselling with the Princesses. Rufus' daughter Kelly (Kristen Schaal) arrives from the future with a dire warning. Space and time is unraveling. They need to write the song right away to save existence. Their daughters Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) try to help by assembling the greatest band ever.I still love the boys. Alex Winter is the same guy, just 30 years older. Keanu is no longer that dude. They should probably try to write to his present day personality. The main takeaway is that they're still good friends and that's the most important part for this movie. My favorite section is the counselling and that section says it all about them. As for the princesses, I accept that they would be different actresses. I do wonder if they could play that up by turning into something completely different. Why not insert different multiple sets of princesses into the movie? Why not use their real life better-half? Instead, they are just a bit younger which is another different and not a fun one. They are now about a decade younger than the guys. My favorite side character remains Death. He just makes me laugh and it's disappointing that he doesn't show up until the second half of the movie. My least favorite new character has to be the killer robot. He's no Station. If he's to redo Death, it would be better to just use Death for that plot device. Maybe the future could trick Death into hunting Bill & Ted for revenge which can be solve again in a game challenge. I like the daughters for the most part. They're pretty good Lil' Bill & Ted. Their quest is a rehash of the first movie. I don't really like the prophecy since it's obvious what the reveal will be. At the end of the day, this is the Bill & Ted franchise. It's not going to make logical sense. The Scooby gang will always remain the best of friends.

It's hard to watch him struggle through it. Same kind of applies to Keanu. He really shows his age here, hard to believe he was 24 or 25 in the first movie and he was playing a teenager? Now he's 55 and still trying to act like one. How has he not changed, mentally?Most ridiculous is Hal Jordan, Keanu's dad, still working as a cop at almost 80 years old? The police scenes with him are just unbelievable. What was the point of this?The whole film was just a train wreck.

Permalink",20,36,4.0,"I saw the original Bill & Ted movies on their original releases. Clearly, I'm a lot older now, and sadly, so are Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter, and their dumb teen routine really isn't befitting of two men in their fifties. To try and get around this, the writers of Face The Music introduce us to the guys' twenty-four-year-old daughters Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and Thea (Samara Weaving, who thankfully isn't called upon to scream at any point); unfortunately, neither actress is very good in their role, and laughs are few and far between.Like their fathers in the first film, Billie and Thea travel through time collecting historical figures: in this case, famous musicians to form a band that will help Bill & Ted to record the song that will save reality and unite all of mankind. Meanwhile, their dads also travel through time, trying to acquire the very same song from their future selves, which leads to several scenes featuring different incarnations of our heroes, Reeves and Winter wearing heavy makeup to play musclebound convicts and pensioners. Following Bill and Ted is a robot called Dennis who has been sent from the future, Terminator-style, to kill the hapless pals for not fulfilling their destiny.This time-twisting plot has plenty of potential for zaniness, but the script fails to make the most of the insanity. Even a visit to Hell to meet their old pal Death (William Sadler) fails to tickle the ribs.One of the film's biggest problems is that none of the historical characters are involved in anything very memorable. In the first film, Napolean went to a water park and ate the Ziggy Pig ice cream, and Joan of Arc led an exercise class at a mall while Genghis Khan trashed a sports shop. It was a lot of fun. In Face The Music, Jimi Hendrix, Mozart, and Louis Armstrong are given nothing of interest to do. Joining in the tedium are a fictional prehistoric drummer, an ancient Chinese flute player I've never heard of (there to appeal to the Chinese market?), and a rapper called Kid Cudi whose presence will seriously date this film in a few years (I'd never heard of him either).The finale, in which the Billie and Thea turn out to be the saviours of reality by leading the band while their dads issue musical instruments to everyone who ever existed (?!?!), is confusing and rushed, and, more importantly, extremely bogus since a) it's not Bill & Ted who unite humanity after all, and b) the music at the end is not very good.

There's no real plot here, the characters have no depth, it's not like they did in the original movies but there weren't so many of them thrown together in one film that it made it feel chaotic and disengaging. Mostly I felt like there wasn't any cohesion whatsoever, it felt as though the script was thrown together in a single night and rushed into production to satisfy fans. The biggest let down is the music, the music is awful. How do you have Dave Grohl cameo and not play? I just don't understand that. Instead we get Kid Cuddi pumping up the crowd (he doesn't sing, which I'm thankful for, but then why is he even there?). Part of what made the Bill and Ted franchise appealing to fans was that it occurred when metal was at it's height, instead of trying to appeal to those same fans, who probably still listen to metal, they instead tried to amalgamate every music genre in the world to appeal to everyone, and it comes off as just that, a hot mess of musical genres.

In some ways, yes, in other ways not quite.

There are some good jokes that land, but its pretty much close to impossible to recreate the magic of the first two films if you ask me. It's definitely my least favourite of the three.That being said, Face the Music is a very easy watch and does have cool references that old fans will appreciate and notice. I wasn't the biggest fan of their daughter characters taking up almost the same amount of screentime as Bill and Ted personally, so whenever it was just them two it kind of lost me for a few minutes with them trying so hard to act like Bill and Ted. I did like the new robot character though and of course seeing old characters reappear and take part again.

It was heavily politicized and the storyline was fractured with little connection to anything remotely comical.Even the Grim Reaper, The Doc of Shook, the Duke of Spook, who i always felt was a hilarious addition to Bogus Journey, was incredibly weak here and his accent was way off.Seeing 50 year old men behave like teenage stoners just didn't work... why not bring back Bethoven like in the original instead of Mozart? Where was the metal and rock influence? It was gone... Who the hell is Kid Kudi and why was he even in the last song? What did he do?The actors playing the daughters are both really good in other projects i've seen them on, but in this they felt like carbon copies of Bill and Ted from the originals and again... it didn't work.This movie gave me serious Ghostbuster Reboot vibes and that is the worst thing I could possibly say about any movie ever.As far as I'm concerned, Bill and Ted ended perfectly in Bogus Journey, and yeah the Reaper really did win the Indy 500 - who knew he could run so fast?",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

This movie is the third in the Bill & Ted series with 29 years since the last one, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, and 31 years since the first one, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure-That's 1989 & 1991 respectively for those of you that are not real good in math. Keanu/Ted and Alex/Bill return to their iconic roles, as does William/Death. George Carlin died sometime after the second one-in 2008 I think-but he does make a short holographic appearance. In his absence, Kristen Schaal plays George's daughter. Keanu & Alex are now middle_aged men with wives and daughters but still have not wrote the song that is supposed to unite the world. Samara plays Alex' daughter and Brigette plays Keanu's daughter. Keanu & Alex are told that they now have to write the song to save the whole universe from blinking out of existence, and of course, there is a time limit with a clock counting down their time. If you liked the first 2 movies, you should enjoy this one. You get to see Keanu & Alex in different time periods and several musical figures throughout time-hint, I have a picture of one of them that I took myself at a concert that is hanging in my living room. Oh yeah, there is a scene after the end credits so don't leave too soon. Party On Dudes!

There has been talk for decades about making a sequel to write the song that unites the world(which they already did, or didn't because this exists). Making a sequel is a tough nut to crack, especially 30 plus years later. To be successful, it has to be both relevant to modern audiences and please the old fans simultaneously. I think it went too far to be modern and as a fan of the previous films I hate this. The storytelling is bad, Bill And Ted are stale, lame and lost their edge. As a comedy, there is nothing here that is funny. There are no metal references here either, where the other films were pretty authentic in that regard. Bill And Ted Face The Music is just lame and as far as sci fi comedic movies go even Hot Tub Time Machine 2 is much better than this as it has some parts that are at least funny. I found this to be watchable, but barely. The whole ""Walk Together, Rock Together"" theme is very positive, but I think I would rather listen to the 7 Seconds album of the same title instead.",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I didn't enjoy this. It messed with the history and wasn't even funny.
Rufus clearly states that Wylde Stallyns' music saves the world, not a specific song and Elizabeth and Joanna are members of the band. Death is the only member to even play the song. Changing the mythology to Preston/Logan is not what Rufus said.
I'm a feminist, but I hate the current trend of crowbarring in female characters. Little Bill and Little Ted were obviously boys. If they really wanted girls in this, they could have had more children.
The Princesses were too young and, if memory serves, they're meant to be the same age, not two years apart.
The plot was predictable, except for Dennis in hell, which wasn't explained.
Waiting decades for a sequel is always a gamble, but this was worse than Episode One and Crystal Skull.
I don't want to turn this into a total rant;
I was mildly amused by Missy re-marrying and by the future Bills and Teds, but I don't think I'll watch it again. Despite still collecting DVDs and having a touch of OCD, when it comes to completing sagas, I won't be buying this.

Permalink",6,11,6.0,"Having just sat through the 1989 and 1991 movies, I got to sit down and watch the 2020 ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"" movie. I must admit that I was a little bit skeptical given the reason that they opted to revive the franchise 29 years after the last movie.But I must say that I was entertained. ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"" from writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon definitely captured the essence of the previous two older movies and brought it up to what you would expect from a modern addition actually. And director Dean Parisot definitely delivered a nicely told movie.The story in ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"" was pretty straight forward, with a nice mixture of elements from the previous two movies. It was a nice story that was quite easy to follow, and there were some nice touches and Easter eggs hidden throughout the storyline.Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter were doing good, as they were in the previous movies and carried the movie quite well with their performances of the Bill & Ted characters. And it was such a blast to have William Sadler, Hal Landon Jr. and Amy Stoch also return to the movie in their roles.I would say that ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"" is definitely a movie that lived up to the expectations resting on it to deliver. And the movie definitely feels like a good continuation of the legacy of the Wyld Stallyns. And even if you haven't seen the previous two movies, this 2020 movie actually manages to do well as a stand-alone movie, though you get a more wholehearted picture of the storyline if you have seen the previous two movies, of course.My rating of ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"" is a six out of ten stars, just as I rated the previous two movies.

This film was never going to top the first two, becasue they are a product of their time, and you can never re-create that, but Bill & Ted Face The Music is a decent enough send off for the characters.It is a bit sad though that it is just ""ok"".

It retreads some ground, but not as much as you would think, and there are genuine laughs in here for sure. Dean Parisot's directing is solid, but a bit lacklustre in places, and I think they should have got Peter Hewitt back from Bogus Journey. It's not awful by any means, but I think it lacks a bit of magic (which was probably the 80s/90s).A special mention must go to Alex Winter who does a great job here. He IS Bill S. Preston, and he has his old mannerisms down to a tee which was very familiar and very comforting.In a way, the film made me a bit sad. Bogus Journey tied up the story quite well, but there was always a bit of the door open to do more if they wanted, and now that it's done it was a kind of uneventful. 1994-ish would have been a perfect time to do a third film, because as upsetting as it is, Bill and Ted with all their ""Wows"" and ""Dudes"", are The past.However, they are MY past, and from MY generation, so I was very happy to see them once last time, and despite all the nitpciks, I had fun with the film.All that's left to say is the best message in any film ever:Be excellent to each other...... and party on!!!",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",372,560,3.0,"So first off. It was very very predictable from the start that the two daughters would end up ""saving the day"".The daughters are super cringe worthy. Bill and Ted were a comedic surfer dude stereotype. The girls take it a step further. They don't just take some mannerisms from their dads they are like a satirical sketch of their dads and it was hard to watch. They could have just been normal or said ""dude/most excellent"" etc without the whole weird body poses etc.On top of that remember bill and Ted used to wear stuff that wasn't that strange or out there for their time periods. They wear super 80s stuff in the 80s and super 90s stuff in the 90s and now they again wear very period appropriate regular clothing. The daughters on the other hand wear these super strange outfits. Esp the short black haired girl was wearing this incredibly weird tight top thing that just looked so stupid and out there.Anyway. So I'm no ""man's rights activist"". In fact o hate those people..but MAN did they try hard to basically remove bill and Ted from the movie and make it as female centric as possible. Before you dislike, hear me out.1. Bill and Ted the leads of the movies are shown as utter failures and versions of then are even worse. Alcoholic, liars, thieves and inmates etc. Even their best versions suck, can't make any good music etc2. They have two daughters who from the start look like they are being set up to take the franchise over. It really looks like the writers / creators would preferably just not use Bill and Ted at all and continue the story with their daughters3. Great ones are now all female.4. Rufus is dead and his daughter now continues his work while his wife has become the great one.5. Ling Lun is a female in the movie (supposed to be male)6. Greatest drummer ever? A black cave woman who makes monkey sounds.*Not only did they turn Ling Lun into a female, which is culturally insensitive. They made a black woman into an ape like cave woman that jumps around like an animal and makes weird faces and monkey noises. How is that acceptable?7. Daughters unlike their dads (who have always been shown as rather daft) are geniuses who understand quantum physics and can write the most brilliant song ever without knowing how to play any instruments etc.*I legit thought the rapper was made up / fake but apparently kid cudi is a real person. And accordihg to the movie he understands quantum physics. WHY? I googled him.hoping he'd have some degree in real life that would justify it, but no. The first thing that came up is that this guy called Jaden Smith ""the chosen one"". I'm sorry but no one with anything over 1/5th of a regular human brain would say that unironically. Why not have an actual intelligent / genius black dude in the movie? It's not like they don't exist and there are far smarter (and better) rappers too. Also, the rapper is station? What? At least it would explain why he is so smart but then again they are using a real life rapper.8. The (male) robot is also an incredible failure. So is Ted's dad9. It's the daughters that manage to convince Death to join the band while B&T fail.10. The daughters are the ones that write the song and save the universe in the end. Bill and Ted are ""there for them"" and ""part of their band"".That doesn't make any sense! And I'm not looking for too much logic in a movie like this, but this is the dumbest (and most predictable) plot twist I've ever seen. If that's the case why does the future worship B&T? Why do they listen to B&Ts music and talk about their song etc? Why not a single reference to their daughters?Also the song SUCKED like it was so bad. It wasn't even really rock even though we heard rock in the future (previous movies). And everyone is supposed to play an instrument. You'd think the song would sound like a giant orchestra but it sounds like some computer generated electronic song with some electric guitar mixed in.To whoever makes these movies. It's OK to make a movie about two (white) dudes. You don't have to shoehorn in female cast members etc or try to turn every movie about a bunch of dudes into a movie about a bunch of dudettes. I'm sure many if not most women also don't care about shoehorned in women. Instead of ruining movies that happen to have male leads with efforts to shoehorn in women, write a good movie with women leads.As a minority I see what Hollywood is doing as well intentioned but it's so damn stupid. Like the virus song that gal gaddot did etc. STOP. Just make good movies. Stop with the forced characters and gender,ethnicity changes etc. Instead make good newmovies about women and minorities etc.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",181,291,3.0,"This is a movie that didn't need to be made.While the opening scene was amusing, the rest of the movie was little more than a mashup of the first two movies. As a story it adds very little to the mythos and storyline of Bill and Ted, and quite frankly had more to do with their daughters (which is really no surprise).Brigette Lundy-Paine actually did a remarkable job emulating the mannerisms of Keanu Reeves 25 years ago, but there just was no real chemistry between her and Samara Weaving, The ending of the film was basically just a rehashing of the ending of the second film where they did the thing and all the world unites (again) in harmony and song, with a maguffin device straight out of Doctor Who.With the original(s) there was at least a sense of growth and maturation with Bill and Ted, overcoming an obstacle. In this, things happened, and then more things happened, and no one was really better or worse for it -- things just happened. Sadly, Hollywood is just bent on regurgitating everything that was delightful and fun 20 years ago, and is dragging everything kicking and screaming into the present. Many were saying this, myself included, that Bill and Ted, like Wayne and Garth, Jay and Silent Bob, Randal and Dante, Han and Chewie, exist in a time that is no longer, and there is no real place for them as they were back then today -- let them stay in the past, so we can build on the legacy for tomorrow.Movies like Bill and Ted are locked in time, and today it just doesn't translate well. There was something interesting about Socrates, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, and Beethoven that fit the narrative well: What would these historical figures think of San Dimas California in the then present time?In this you just have an assortment of random, name dropped historical figures, Mozart, Hendrix, Louie Armstrong, some cave man on drums, Kid Cudi and a Chinese Flute Player, all who are just there for no real rhyme or reason, more so because they came up on an algorithm generated by Spotify or Apple Music based on ""your personal likes"".For the most part, I found the story and the film to be lacking in any real substance (and this is comparing it to the not at all serious, light hearted BaT:EA and BaT:BJ), or point. It was just... there, and then it was done. It adds nothing new or interesting, and really doesn't have to be watched at all.

Permalink",215,323,5.0,"I loved Bill & Ted! I watched the movies, cartoon, started saying 'dude' and bogus because of it, and hoped that this would be a nostalgic look back to my early teens. And it kind of was, in a way. And there was a sweetness in watching Bill&Ted again fumble their way to saving the world/universe/reality.But the problems with B&T are the usual problems with most remarks and sequels coming out of Hollywood.* I'm definitely for equality, but the males (with backstory) in the film are either dysfunctional or complete idiots while the women come to save the day because they're portrayed as smarter and more resourceful. Spread the cluelessness around, and spread the resourcefulness around.* (Future) Bill&Ted were even painted as being manipulative and nasty in some parts, which is not who they were in the original films.* the daughters bring everyone together in the end and are credited with creating THE SONG. But neither plays an instrument and just offer some feedback on what each musician was attempting to do. So they don't really have any talent other than telling seasoned and talented musicians what to do (cause the daughters listened to lots of music and therefore know better then them I suppose). If they are to be the heroes then they really should have had stronger parts written for them.
Hollywood, if you're going for strong female leads in a film then give the female lead a backstory, with skills that justify them being in that role. No-one deserves a leading role just because they fit a particular demographic.* the music. What can I say other than there was soooo much more they could have done with this. The music in B&T was build around the time period they were in. Metal & rock were cool at the time so the original films can be placed in a time period. This one however... it's almost like they didn't have a clear idea of what they wanted to portray.* I have to say I like Bill's daughter and how she tried to go full Bill/Keanu. She nailed a lot of his idiosyncratic movements and facial expression. Ted's daughter though could have been played by anyone. So this missed the beat for me. Either make sure the daughters are girl versions of the Dads, give them their own personalities&mannerisms, or even swap them (Ted's daughter behaves like Bill and vice versa). Unfortunately we got half of one of these.There are more, but other reviewers have covered these points.Finally, I just want to say that it's sad that the film missed the point of Bill&Ted - it was never about saving the world, or their marriages. They were just 2 sweet dudes, a little clueless, trying to do what they thought was right in their own way. And we like seeing their positivity come through even when times were rough. And because they were always positive things worked out in the end, sometimes with a little help from Rufus.There was a glimmer of that here, but not enough.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

I wish I'd seen the movie they saw, because this one was pretty bad.There are a few good things in Face the Music.

And Brigette Lundy-Paine is wonderful as Billie, perfectly capturing Keanu Reeve's physicality.On the other hand, during the entire movie there were only 4 or 5 times when I actually laughed. Not belly laughs, just little ones. The movie is simply not funny. I'm not even sure it's *trying* to be funny.At one point in the movie Dave Groh came up and I asked my girlfriend, ""who's Dave Groh.""

Permalink",15,22,7.0,"Bill Preston (Alex Winter) and Ted Logan (Keanu Reeves) are still struggling to write their epic song. They have broken up with Death (William Sadler). They start couples counselling with the Princesses. Rufus' daughter Kelly (Kristen Schaal) arrives from the future with a dire warning. Space and time is unraveling. They need to write the song right away to save existence. Their daughters Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) try to help by assembling the greatest band ever.I still love the boys. Alex Winter is the same guy, just 30 years older. Keanu is no longer that dude. They should probably try to write to his present day personality. The main takeaway is that they're still good friends and that's the most important part for this movie. My favorite section is the counselling and that section says it all about them. As for the princesses, I accept that they would be different actresses. I do wonder if they could play that up by turning into something completely different. Why not insert different multiple sets of princesses into the movie? Why not use their real life better-half? Instead, they are just a bit younger which is another different and not a fun one. They are now about a decade younger than the guys. My favorite side character remains Death. He just makes me laugh and it's disappointing that he doesn't show up until the second half of the movie. My least favorite new character has to be the killer robot. He's no Station. If he's to redo Death, it would be better to just use Death for that plot device. Maybe the future could trick Death into hunting Bill & Ted for revenge which can be solve again in a game challenge. I like the daughters for the most part. They're pretty good Lil' Bill & Ted. Their quest is a rehash of the first movie. I don't really like the prophecy since it's obvious what the reveal will be. At the end of the day, this is the Bill & Ted franchise. It's not going to make logical sense. The Scooby gang will always remain the best of friends.

To try and get around this, the writers of Face The Music introduce us to the guys' twenty-four-year-old daughters Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and Thea (Samara Weaving, who thankfully isn't called upon to scream at any point); unfortunately, neither actress is very good in their role, and laughs are few and far between.Like their fathers in the first film, Billie and Thea travel through time collecting historical figures: in this case, famous musicians to form a band that will help Bill & Ted to record the song that will save reality and unite all of mankind. Meanwhile, their dads also travel through time, trying to acquire the very same song from their future selves, which leads to several scenes featuring different incarnations of our heroes, Reeves and Winter wearing heavy makeup to play musclebound convicts and pensioners. Following Bill and Ted is a robot called Dennis who has been sent from the future, Terminator-style, to kill the hapless pals for not fulfilling their destiny.This time-twisting plot has plenty of potential for zaniness, but the script fails to make the most of the insanity. Even a visit to Hell to meet their old pal Death (William Sadler) fails to tickle the ribs.One of the film's biggest problems is that none of the historical characters are involved in anything very memorable. In the first film, Napolean went to a water park and ate the Ziggy Pig ice cream, and Joan of Arc led an exercise class at a mall while Genghis Khan trashed a sports shop. It was a lot of fun. In Face The Music, Jimi Hendrix, Mozart, and Louis Armstrong are given nothing of interest to do. Joining in the tedium are a fictional prehistoric drummer, an ancient Chinese flute player I've never heard of (there to appeal to the Chinese market?), and a rapper called Kid Cudi whose presence will seriously date this film in a few years (I'd never heard of him either).The finale, in which the Billie and Thea turn out to be the saviours of reality by leading the band while their dads issue musical instruments to everyone who ever existed (?!?!), is confusing and rushed, and, more importantly, extremely bogus since a) it's not Bill & Ted who unite humanity after all, and b) the music at the end is not very good. Perhaps they should have played something by Dave Grohl after all.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

There are a couple of jokes in the beginning that were funny, but it fizzles out thereafter. There's no real plot here, the characters have no depth, it's not like they did in the original movies but there weren't so many of them thrown together in one film that it made it feel chaotic and disengaging. Mostly I felt like there wasn't any cohesion whatsoever, it felt as though the script was thrown together in a single night and rushed into production to satisfy fans. The biggest let down is the music, the music is awful. How do you have Dave Grohl cameo and not play? I just don't understand that. Instead we get Kid Cuddi pumping up the crowd (he doesn't sing, which I'm thankful for, but then why is he even there?). Part of what made the Bill and Ted franchise appealing to fans was that it occurred when metal was at it's height, instead of trying to appeal to those same fans, who probably still listen to metal, they instead tried to amalgamate every music genre in the world to appeal to everyone, and it comes off as just that, a hot mess of musical genres.

In some ways, yes, in other ways not quite. If you're happy to see both Bill and Ted together trying to recapture the attitude they had in the first two movies, they sort of half-succeed at doing it, despite feeling a little awkward at them being way older now. There are some good jokes that land, but its pretty much close to impossible to recreate the magic of the first two films if you ask me. It's definitely my least favourite of the three.That being said, Face the Music is a very easy watch and does have cool references that old fans will appreciate and notice. I wasn't the biggest fan of their daughter characters taking up almost the same amount of screentime as Bill and Ted personally, so whenever it was just them two it kind of lost me for a few minutes with them trying so hard to act like Bill and Ted. I did like the new robot character though and of course seeing old characters reappear and take part again. Make no mistake, this movie does aim for nostalgia and familiar story beats, but you know what it was an alright sequel that could have been way, way worse like Dumb and Dumber To.

Permalink",14,22,1.0,"It pains me to be writing this about a Bill & Ted flick, then again I'd HARDLY consider this a Bill &Ted flick. Just because you direct the actors to say ""Dude"" 17 trillion times, doesn't make it authentic.This film is like if they made a new Ace Ventura, but instead of developing a legitimate story to fill fans with joy and nostalgia, they just lazily wrote in a daughter and made everyone sit through 2 hours of mediocre, cringeworthy scenes complimented by EVER SO SUBTLE Georgia O'keeffe stylings. And in the end Ace Ventura was never the true Pet Detective... it was his glorious, inspiring, jaw-droppingly beautiful daughter who will eventually become president and inaugurate a new ""epoch"" in which women govern all of human existence and everything is rainbow and tastes like strawberry-cream dandy lions. -__-Ruining all formerly watch-able content, Go Feminism!This film received SUCH positive coverage in the media, it was suspicious in all honesty. And now that I've seen it, I know why the media was pumping it... even the ""coronavirus"" can't stop these clowns from destroying classics with modern political/social agendas.",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",12,23,7.0,"I saw ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"", starring Keanu Reeves-the John Wick movies, The Day the Earth Stood Still_2008; Alex Winter-The Lost Boys, Death Wish 3; Samara Weaving-Ready or Not, Monster Trucks; Brigette Lundy_Paine-Bombshell, Downsizing and William Sadler-The Grudge_2020, Die Hard 2.
This movie is the third in the Bill & Ted series with 29 years since the last one, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, and 31 years since the first one, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure-That's 1989 & 1991 respectively for those of you that are not real good in math. Keanu/Ted and Alex/Bill return to their iconic roles, as does William/Death. George Carlin died sometime after the second one-in 2008 I think-but he does make a short holographic appearance. In his absence, Kristen Schaal plays George's daughter. Keanu & Alex are now middle_aged men with wives and daughters but still have not wrote the song that is supposed to unite the world. Samara plays Alex' daughter and Brigette plays Keanu's daughter. Keanu & Alex are told that they now have to write the song to save the whole universe from blinking out of existence, and of course, there is a time limit with a clock counting down their time. If you liked the first 2 movies, you should enjoy this one. You get to see Keanu & Alex in different time periods and several musical figures throughout time-hint, I have a picture of one of them that I took myself at a concert that is hanging in my living room. Oh yeah, there is a scene after the end credits so don't leave too soon. Party On Dudes!
It's rated ""PG13"" for some language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.
I liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Warning: Spoilers,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2

Permalink",2,2,6.0,"As a big fan of the original, the second one was ok, I watched the 3rd instalment with trepidation. I was half right, though not as bad as I thought it doesn't do enough to be worthwhile. Twenty odd years after the second film Bill and Ted are still losers, living off past glories ( though they are long gone ) and in counselling with their princess wives. Luckily they have two daughters ( the stars of the film, tbh ) to save the day for them. They gather a band of great musicians from the past to perform a song that will truly unite the planet ( sounds like the Eurovision Song Contest to me ).

Permalink",12,22,7.0,"I have never thought of the originals or this movie as anything than what they are. They aren't cult classics, they aren't ""the best"" of anything. They're just good goofy fun movies. And at that they excel. You're not gonna walk away thinking you just saw the next big thing, these types of movies are the kind that you watch one, enjoy. And then remember fondly.The plot is pretty much the same as the other 2, the basic breakdown is bill and ted have a goal, they have to travel through time to reach set goal, and they learn lessons along the way. Now granted this movie was a little more ""woke"" than the other two, but that's just because of the time it was released, this is a very woke year.Enjoy this movie for what it is, don't expect fireworks, and be excellent. 7/10",,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Adventure,Comedy,Music",5.9,2020,0,91.0,52517,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/reviews/?ref_=tt_ql_2
